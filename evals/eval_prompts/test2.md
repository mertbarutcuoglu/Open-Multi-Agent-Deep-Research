Topic: Economic and urban impacts of remote work on downtown office districts in the U.S. and Western Europe (2019–2025)

Objectives:

* Quantify changes in office occupancy, effective rents, and transaction values.
* Measure spillover effects on transit ridership, retail sales, and foot traffic.
* Identify policy and zoning responses correlated with stabilization or recovery.

Key questions:

* How did Class A vs Class B/C vacancy and effective rent trends diverge post-2020?
* What is the relationship between office utilization and weekday transit ridership by city?
* How have retail sales and pedestrian counts within 0.5 miles of CBD cores shifted?
* Which policy interventions (e.g., office-to-residential conversions, tax incentives) show measurable outcomes within 12–24 months?
* What constraints impede conversion feasibility at scale?

Focus areas:

* Office utilization vs lease occupancy vs physical badge-swipe rates.
* Sublease inventory, concessions, and lease term structures.
* Retail and hospitality indicators within CBD census tracts.
* Capital markets: cap rates, distress indicators, CMBS delinquency rates.
* Policy case studies with before/after metrics.

Exclusions:

* Company-specific HR strategies or productivity claims.
* Long-term speculative scenarios beyond 2025.
* Non-CBD suburban office trends unless needed as a counterfactual.

Geographic scope: Top 10 metros by office inventory in the U.S.; London, Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam.

Time scope: January 1, 2019 through September 30, 2025.

Audience: Urban policy makers, municipal finance teams, real-estate investors.

Must include:

* Comparative tables for vacancy, effective rents, utilization, and transit ridership.
* A short conversion feasibility rubric (physical, financial, regulatory).
* Clear definitions for “utilization,” “occupancy,” and “vacancy.”

Must avoid:

* Vendor or broker marketing language.
* Anecdotes without data.
* Forecasts beyond the stated time scope.
