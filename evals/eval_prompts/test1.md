Topic: Safety outcomes of autonomous vehicles relative to human drivers in urban North America (2018–2025)

Objectives:

* Quantify comparative safety outcomes.
* Identify primary incident categories and contributing factors.
* Highlight regulatory reporting gaps that affect comparability.

Key questions:

* What are collision, injury, and fatality rates per vehicle-mile for AVs vs human-driven vehicles?
* How do outcomes vary by city and operating domain (day/night, weather, speed limits)?
* What incident types dominate AV reports (e.g., rear-end while stationary, disengagement-adjacent events)?
* Which data limitations or reporting differences bias comparisons?

Focus areas:

* Incident rates normalized by exposure (miles or hours).
* Severity distribution (property damage only, injury, fatality).
* Operational design domain constraints for AV services.
* Regulatory reporting frameworks and definitions (e.g., “disengagement,” “reportable crash”).

Exclusions:

* Engineering implementation details of perception/planning stacks.
* Market forecasts or TAM sizing.
* Speculation on future legislation beyond Q3 2025.

Geographic scope: United States and Canada, city-level where available.

Time scope: January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2025.

Audience: Policy analysts with technical literacy; non-specialist executive readers.

Evidence requirements:

* Source types: official crash databases and agency reports; company transparency or safety reports; peer-reviewed or preprint studies with disclosed methods; major newspaper or trade press only for corroboration.
* Citation style: inline numeric with reference list.
* Minimum independent sources per key claim: 2.

Must include:

* A clear table of normalized rates.
* Definitions for all rate denominators.
* A short rubric describing comparability limits.

Must avoid:

* Vendor marketing language.
* Uncited anecdotes.
* Predictions beyond the stated time scope.
