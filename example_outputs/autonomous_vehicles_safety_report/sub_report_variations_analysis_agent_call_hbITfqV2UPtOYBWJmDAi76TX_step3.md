(Each factual claim below cites at least two of the above sources; where a claim uses data from a web_extract call the specific URL used is included after the claim as [Source: <url>].)

1) City-level patterns (summary)
- Phoenix (AZ): AV operations (principally Waymo rider-only) show the largest exposure (Waymo reports ~46.39M rider-only miles through June 2025) and substantially lower injury and serious-crash rates versus local human benchmarks in Waymo’s published analysis (e.g., Waymo reports any-injury IPMM = 0.63 vs benchmark 2.06 in Phoenix; Waymo’s multi-city analyses report large reductions in injury/airbag/serious-crash metrics). These Waymo city-level results are drawn from SGO-submitted crash reports and Waymo’s disclosed VMT and benchmark methodology [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/]. [1][2]

- San Francisco (CA): Waymo’s analyses show lower crash rates vs local human benchmarks but higher any-injury IPMM and higher airbag-deployment IPMM in San Francisco than Phoenix (Waymo reports San Francisco any-injury IPMM 0.90 vs benchmark 7.93). San Francisco’s AV crash counts also appear in NHTSA SGO summaries for California; California DMV maintains collision report files for AV test fleets operating in SF (many reports redacted). These city-specific differences appear in Waymo’s city tables and are consistent with larger human-benchmark crash rates in dense San Francisco street networks [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]. [3][4]

- Los Angeles (CA) and Austin (TX): Waymo discloses LA and Austin RO mileage and reports crash-rate comparisons; LA shows low IPMM in some metrics (LA serious-crash IPMM 0.00 in Waymo table) but sample sizes differ. Austin’s exposure is small (Waymo notes limited mileage in Austin makes some comparisons not statistically significant). NHTSA SGO national summaries show California (including LA) has many of the reported ADS incidents but redaction and reporting differences complicate cross-city fault attribution [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf]. [5][6]

- Toronto (ON, Canada): Public AV operations in Toronto are limited compared with the U.S. robotaxi deployments. Toronto’s municipal documents show pilot approvals for delivery and shuttle pilots and planning work (city tactical plan, pilot approvals), but there is little evidence of high-exposure rider-only robotaxi VMT comparable to Waymo’s U.S. cities; therefore city-level AV safety comparisons vs humans are not possible with current public data. Toronto pilot documentation and municipal records provide planning detail but not large-scale crash-rate benchmarks or VMT for AVs in Toronto through 2025 Q3 [Source: https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2025/ie/bgrd/backgroundfile-254933.pdf, https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/7ec4-TS_AV-Tactical-Plan_Technical-Report.pdf]. [7][8]

2) Operating-domain breakdowns (day/night, weather, posted speed bands)
- Speed (posted limit) distribution of reported AV crashes: NHTSA SGO summary (LSD Data analysis) shows the majority of reported ADS crashes occurred on roads with posted speed limits <=25 mph (404 incidents) vs 167 incidents on 30–55 mph roads and 33 on 60–75 mph roads (counts as reported to NHTSA, July 2024 summary). This indicates AV-reported crashes are concentrated on low-speed surface streets where many ADS services operate [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf]. [9][10]

- Day vs Night: NHTSA SGO summary shows 59.5% (367/617) of reported ADS crashes were in daylight, 35.0% (216/617) in dark-but-lighted conditions, 3.4% at dawn/dusk, and 1.3% in dark-not-lighted (counts as of July 2024). Because VMT by lighting condition is not published in SGO reports (and AV operators do not publicly release crash counts stratified by lighting together with VMT by lighting), rates per-million-miles by lighting cannot be computed from public SGO/Waymo data alone — only proportions of reported incidents. Thus, while a majority of reported ADS crashes happened in daylight (absolute counts), we cannot conclude whether AV crash risk per-mile is higher or lower at night without lighting-stratified exposure (VMT) data [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [11][12]

- Weather / road surface: In NHTSA SGO summary counts, 92.9% of reported ADS crashes occurred on dry roads, 6.3% on wet roads, and 0.2% in snow/slush/ice (July 2024 summary). These proportions largely reflect AV operational domains and seasonality (operators avoid severe-weather operations in many deployments). Because exposure by weather condition (VMT in rain/snow vs dry) is not publicly available for most operators, it is not possible to compute weather-specific AV crash rates vs human rates from public SGO data alone — only the distribution of reported incidents. Waymo and other operators state they limit or modify operations in adverse weather, consistent with the low share of snow-related reports in the SGO summary [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/blog/2024/09/safety-data-hub/]. [13][14]

- Injury / serious-crash metrics by city (Waymo RO private-vehicle comparisons): Waymo’s research and safety hub provide incidents-per-million-miles (IPMM) by city and benchmark comparisons: example figures (Waymo – RO through Oct/June datasets): Phoenix any-injury IPMM 0.63 vs human benchmark 2.06; San Francisco any-injury IPMM 0.90 vs human benchmark 7.93; All-locations any-injury IPMM 0.80 vs benchmark 3.96. Waymo reports large percent reductions (e.g., ~80% fewer injury-causing crashes overall) compared with human benchmarks for the same roadway types and locations. These city-level IPMM comparisons are subject to Waymo’s benchmark construction and statistical uncertainty (Waymo notes some comparisons are not statistically significant where exposure is small) [Source: https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [15][16]

3) Key findings (narrative, facts-only) with quantified uncertainty and data limitations
- Finding 1 — AV crash reports are concentrated on low-speed surface streets and in dry/daylight conditions (counts): Public SGO summary counts show most reported ADS crashes were on roads <=25 mph and on dry pavement; lighting counts show majority daytime. This aligns with how commercial AV services state they operate (surface streets, restricted speeds, selective-weather operations). However, counts alone do not equal rates; without exposure (VMT) stratified by speed band, lighting, and weather we cannot compute per-mile risk by condition for the overall ADS population. Uncertainty: high for per-mile comparisons by lighting and weather due to lack of exposure data. [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [17][18]

- Finding 2 — Where high-exposure, well-documented deployments exist (Waymo in Phoenix, SF, LA, Austin), operators report lower injury and serious-crash rates vs local human benchmarks: Waymo’s peer-reviewed analysis and safety hub quantify large percent reductions in injury/serious crash measures in Phoenix and San Francisco using SGO crash reports and operator-provided VMT. These comparisons are statistically significant in some city-level comparisons (Waymo reports significance for Phoenix and San Francisco) but are sensitive to benchmark choice and possible benchmark under-reporting bias; Waymo and independent reviewers caution interpreting the results as one piece of a safety case rather than definitive causal proof. Uncertainty: moderate — lower for absolute IPMM in Waymo data (they disclose VMT), higher for cross-operator generalization and for establishing causality vs selection/route differences. [Source: https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/; https://waymo.com/blog/2024/09/safety-data-hub/; https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/self-driving-vehicles-could-struggle-to-eliminate-most-crashes]. [19][20]

- Finding 3 — AV crash reporting system limitations and redactions constrain cross-city, cross-operator synthesis: NHTSA SGO reports are useful but contain redactions, unverified preliminary details, and do not provide full exposure metrics or consistent fields for e.g., lighting-duration VMT, operator-controlled route vs. non-routed miles, or full fault attribution. State and city collision logs (e.g., CA DMV AV collision reports) provide incident files but many are redacted and submitted under varying timelines; this complicates direct aggregation and per-mile rate calculations across operators or cities. Quantified data gap: SGO summary (July 2024) reports 617 incidents counted but notes redactions and possible duplicate reports; exposure (operator VMT by condition) is frequently absent from public filings. [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]. [21][22]

- Finding 4 — AV operators limit operations (speed/conditions) and that operational design bias affects observed safety patterns: Waymo and other operators explicitly restrict operations to surface streets, map and operate at conservative speeds, and limit operations in severe weather or low-visibility conditions — these policies both reduce exposure to higher-speed, adverse-weather crashes (producing the observed concentration on low-speed/dry/daytime reports) and complicate any direct comparison with unconstrained human driving. IIHS analysis also notes that many crashes stem from planning and decision errors (e.g., speeding) that AVs would only avoid if programmed to do so; hence AV operational choices (slow, rule-abiding) are a major mechanism behind reduced injury-crash metrics in published operator comparisons. Uncertainty: moderate; policy/operational differences make generalization across operators and cities uncertain. [Source: https://waymo.com/blog/2024/09/safety-data-hub/; https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/self-driving-vehicles-could-struggle-to-eliminate-most-crashes; https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2024/cruise-releases-third-party-findings-regarding-october-2/]. [23][24]

- Finding 5 — City-to-city heterogeneity: Phoenix (ample RO exposure) shows the clearest, statistically supported reductions in injury metrics in Waymo’s analysis; San Francisco shows larger human-benchmark crash rates (particularly for some severe metrics), producing larger percent reductions when compared against Waymo’s observed IPMM — but absolute Waymo IPMMs differ by city. Toronto and many Canadian municipalities do not have comparable RO exposure (no large robotaxi fleets) so city-level AV vs human comparisons are not possible there using public data through 2025 Q3. Uncertainty: low for the descriptive statement of heterogeneity (documented in Waymo and SGO/DMV files); high for cross-city causal claims. [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2025/ie/bgrd/backgroundfile-254933.pdf]. [25][26]

4) Short quantified domain examples and the caveats that accompany them
- Example: As-of-July-2024 SGO summary counts — posted-speed band: <=25 mph: 404 incidents (≈65% of 617 reported), 30–55 mph: 167 (≈27%), 60–75 mph: 33 (≈5%) [Source: NHTSA SGO summary]. Because operator VMT by posted-speed band is not provided in SGO public reporting we cannot convert those counts to IPMM by speed band without making strong assumptions about exposure. [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [27][28]

- Example: Lighting: 59.5% daylight vs 35% dark-but-lighted (SGO counts). Conversion to per-mile risk would require VMT by lighting; Waymo and other operators do not disclose lighting-stratified VMT publicly in SGO filings; therefore percent differences reported here are counts-only and not per-mile comparisons. Uncertainty: high for any causal claims about night vs day per-mile risk. [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [29][30]

5) Data quality & gaps (quantified where possible)
- Redactions & missing fields: SGO reports and many state/city AV collision PDFs are redacted for confidentiality; this removes key contextual details (fault, distraction, precise timestamps), limiting ability to code cause categories reliably. (SGO summary explicitly notes redactions and preliminary/unverified data.) [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]. [31][32]

- Missing exposure stratification: Operator VMT is sometimes disclosed in aggregate (Waymo’s RO miles by city), but exposure broken out by time-of-day, weather, or posted-speed band is not publicly available across operators; this prevents robust per-condition rate estimates. Quantified gap: SGO summary had 617 incidents in July 2024 snapshot but did not provide matched exposure (VMT) per condition; Waymo discloses 96M RO miles through June 2025 but not lighting/weather-split VMT in the public hub. [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [33][34]

- Cross-operator generalizability: The strongest per-mile claims are possible only for operators that disclose both crash reports and VMT by city (Waymo provides the most complete public city-level RO VMT and SGO-based crash lists). Other operators (Cruise, Zoox, Nuro, etc.) publish less complete VMT or have more redaction, limiting pooled analyses. Quantified implication: AV safety patterns in public analyses are dominated by Waymo exposure because Waymo discloses tens of millions of RO miles — hence results may reflect Waymo operational design choices as much as intrinsic ADS capabilities. [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]. [35][36]

6) Short conclusion (neutral, facts-only)
- Public SGO and state/city AV reports through 2025 Q3 indicate that reported ADS crashes are concentrated on low-speed surface streets, in dry conditions, and during daytime (counts). Where an operator provides both crash counts and exposure (Waymo), per‑million‑mile comparisons to carefully constructed local human benchmarks show fewer injury and serious crashes for Waymo’s rider-only operations in cities with substantial exposure (notably Phoenix and San Francisco). However, limitations in public exposure detail (VMT by lighting/weather/speed band), redactions in incident files, and operator operational constraints (avoiding high-speed or severe-weather operations) create substantial uncertainty for condition-specific per‑mile risk comparisons. The strongest, most reliable city-level comparisons are currently limited to operators and cities where both VMT and crash data are publicly disclosed (principally Waymo in Phoenix/SF/LA/Austin) [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/; https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/self-driving-vehicles-could-struggle-to-eliminate-most-crashes].
