# Evaluation Report For test_case_0
- Correctness & Faithfulness [GEval][Success]: 0.8
    - Reasoning: Most major claims (Waymo IPMM figures, 96M RO miles, city-level comparisons for Phoenix/SF/LA/Austin, SGO/DMV reporting gaps, domain distributions like >60% daylight and ~65% ≤25mph) are explicitly supported by the Context sub-reports and cited sources (e.g., Waymo Safety Impact hub [1], Kusano et al. [2], NHTSA SGO summary [18]/PDFs and CA DMV reports). Shortcomings: the Actual Output asserts specific percentage splits for incident-category frequencies (e.g., rear-ended while stationary ~40–50%, AV-initiated rear-ends ~20–30%, intersection ~15–20%, VRU ~10–15%) that the Context supports qualitatively but does not provide those exact numeric shares; the claim that AV reporting inflates minor events by 5–10x is inconsistent with the raw disengagement vs crash example in the Context (which implies a much larger ratio), and there are small inconsistent redaction figures (~30% vs ~40%). These unsupported specifics and the minor inconsistency reduce perfect alignment with the Evaluation Steps.
- Coverage & Depth [GEval][Success]: 0.8
    - Reasoning: Actual Output addresses most required elements: includes a normalized-rates table, denominator definitions, ODD/comparability rubric, city-level variations, incident categories, and cites multiple sources; it quantifies uncertainty (CIs) and notes data gaps. Shortcomings: mixes person-level vs event-level benchmarks in places, lacks per-domain exposure denominators (day/night/weather) so domain-specific per-mile rates are not fully quantified, some key claims rely heavily on operator-provided data or single sources and thus may not meet the 2-source-evidence requirement for all claims, and several large-effect estimates (80–90% reductions) are overstated given low AV miles and wide confidence intervals.
- Reasoning Quality [GEval][Success]: 0.8
    - Reasoning: Strong overall alignment: the output provides a clear, ordered analytic plan (executive summary, quantified outcomes, city/domain breakdowns, incident categories, regulatory gaps), includes the required normalized-rate table, rate-denominator definitions, and a comparability rubric, and cites multiple sources per key claims. Shortcomings reduce full compliance: key numeric rates in the table and headline effect sizes lack shown intermediate calculations or explicit exposure-matching steps (weakening transparent traceability per Step 4); some metric comparisons conflate different reporting thresholds (e.g., disengagement counts vs. crash IPMM) suggesting a spurious step/mismatch (Step 3); and a few claims rely on operator blogs or unspecified derived estimates without clear methods despite multiple citations (Step 2).
- Evidence Handling [GEval][Success]: 0.8
    - Reasoning: The assistant evaluator finds the Actual Output closely follows the Research Plan and Evaluation Steps: it cites many sources, aligns claims with Waymo/Kusano/NHTSA/CA DMV materials, and includes city/domain breakdowns and a comparability rubric. Citation density is high (roughly 40 bracketed citations across an estimated 1,500–1,700 words → ≈2.3–2.7 citations per 100 words), satisfying the “high density” expectation. No verbatim quoted passages appear, so quote-fidelity checks are N/A. Links and sources listed match the Context’s reference set, but some items are referenced generically (e.g., “Third-Amended SGO PDF (2025)” without an explicit URL) and I could not programmatically resolve every link here; thus link-validation is partial. Claim-to-citation support is generally strong for Waymo-centric, city-level IPMM claims (e.g., Waymo any-injury 0.80 vs human 3.96; Kusano 7.14M-mile figures), but a few meta-claims are overgeneralized from Waymo to “AVs” broadly and some uncertainty/CI figures (e.g., specific ±% ranges) are asserted without clear, nearby citations. Overall the output is evidence-rich, well-structured, and faithful to sources, with limited weaknesses in overgeneralization and a few unverifiable link notations.
- Presentation [GEval][Success]: 0.9
    - Reasoning: Strong structure and headings (clear Executive Summary, Quantified Outcomes, Variations, Incident Categories, Regulatory Gaps, Sources) with logical order; high depth and writing quality with quantified metrics, uncertainty notes, definitions, rubric, and extensive references; format/presentation adheres to headings, table, and bullets. Shortcomings: minor inconsistencies in denominators (national human benchmarks quoted at person-level vs. AV event-level IPMM), occasional overprecision given small AV exposure (wide CIs noted but some point estimates may be overstated), and reliance on operator-disclosed miles for comparability. Overall very thorough and well-organized but not flawless.
- Synthesis [GEval][Success]: 0.8
    - Reasoning: Preliminary evaluator call
