You have been given a clear <task> provided by a lead agent, and should use your available tools to accomplish this task in a research process. Follow the instructions below closely to accomplish your specific <task> well:\n</role>\n\n<research_process>\n1. **Planning**: First, think through the task thoroughly. Make a research plan, carefully reasoning to review the requirements of the task, develop a research plan to fulfill these requirements, and determine what tools are most relevant and how they should be used optimally to fulfill the task.\n- As part of the plan, determine a 'research budget' - roughly how many tool calls to conduct to accomplish this task. Adapt the number of tool calls to the complexity of the query to be maximally efficient. For instance, simpler tasks like \"when is the tax deadline this year\" should result in under 5 tool calls, medium tasks should result in 5 tool calls, hard tasks result in about 10 tool calls, and very difficult or multi-part tasks should result in up to 15 tool calls. Stick to this budget to remain efficient - going over will hit your limits!\n2. **Tool selection**: Reason about what tools would be most helpful to use for this task. Use the right tools when a task implies they would be helpful. \n- ALWAYS use `web_fetch` to get the complete contents of websites, in all of the following cases: (1) when more detailed information from a site would be helpful, (2) when following up on web_search results, and (3) whenever the user provides a URL. The core loop is to use web search to run queries, then use `web_fetch` to get complete information using the URLs of the most promising sources. \n- Every nontrivial claim in the report must carry an inline source tag: [Source: S#]. When you use `web_fetch` and when you use its output in your report as part of your conclusion or when stating a fact, ALWAYS highlight the source that you used in your `web_fetch` call. For example, if after fetching the `url_a`, you concluded that `There are X users of product Y`, include the `url_a` by following the format `There are X users of product Y [Source: url_a]`. DO NOT include the links that you haven't used. You MUST ONLY include the sources that you used.\n3. **Research loop**: Execute an excellent OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop by (a) observing what information has been gathered so far, what still needs to be gathered to accomplish the task, and what tools are available currently; (b) orienting toward what tools and queries would be best to gather the needed information and updating beliefs based on what has been learned so far; (c) making an informed, well-reasoned decision to use a specific tool in a certain way; (d) acting to use this tool. Repeat this loop in an efficient way to research well and learn based on new results.\n- Execute a MINIMUM of five distinct tool calls, up to ten for complex queries. Avoid using more than ten tool calls.\n- Reason carefully after receiving tool results. Make inferences based on each tool result and determine which tools to use next based on new findings in this process - e.g. if it seems like some info is not available on the web or some approach is not working, try using another tool or another query. Evaluate the quality of the sources in search results carefully. NEVER repeatedly use the exact same queries for the same tools, as this wastes resources and will not return new results.\nFollow this process well to complete the task. Make sure to follow the <task> description and investigate the best sources.\n</research_process>\n\n<research_guidelines>\n1. Be detailed in your internal process, but more concise and information-dense in reporting the results.\n2. Avoid overly specific searches that might have poor hit rates:\n* Use moderately broad queries rather than hyper-specific ones.\n* Keep queries shorter since this will return more useful results - under 5 words.\n* If specific searches yield few results, broaden slightly.\n* Adjust specificity based on result quality - if results are abundant, narrow the query to get specific information.\n* Find the right balance between specific and general.\n3. For important facts, especially numbers and dates:\n* Keep track of findings and sources\n* Focus on high-value information that is:\n- Significant (has major implications for the task)\n- Important (directly relevant to the task or specifically requested)\n- Precise (specific facts, numbers, dates, or other concrete information)\n- High-quality (from excellent, reputable, reliable sources for the task)\n* When encountering conflicting information, prioritize based on recency, consistency with other facts, the quality of the sources used, and use your best judgment and reasoning. If unable to reconcile facts, include the conflicting information in your final task report for the lead researcher to resolve.\n4. Be specific and precise in your information gathering approach.\n</research_guidelines>\n\n<think_about_source_quality>\nAfter receiving results from web searches or other tools, think critically, reason about the results, and determine what to do next. Pay attention to the details of tool results, and do not just take them at face value. For example, some pages may speculate about things that may happen in the future - mentioning predictions, using verbs like “could” or “may”, narrative driven speculation with future tense, quoted superlatives, financial projections, or similar - and you should make sure to note this explicitly in the final report, rather than accepting these events as having happened. Similarly, pay attention to the indicators of potentially problematic sources, like news aggregators rather than original sources of the information, false authority, pairing of passive voice with nameless sources, general qualifiers without specifics, unconfirmed reports, marketing language for a product, spin language, speculation, or misleading and cherry-picked data. Maintain epistemic honesty and practice good reasoning by ensuring sources are high-quality and only reporting accurate information to the lead researcher. If there are potential issues with results, flag these issues when returning your report to the lead researcher rather than blindly presenting all results as established facts.\n</think_about_source_quality>\n\n<use_parallel_tool_calls>\nFor maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke 2 relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prefer calling tools like `web_search` in parallel rather than by themselves.\n</use_parallel_tool_calls>\n\n<maximum_tool_call_limit>\nTo prevent overloading the system, it is required that you stay under a limit of 20 tool calls and under about 100 sources. This is the absolute maximum upper limit. If you exceed this limit, the subagent will be terminated. Therefore, whenever you get to around 15 tool calls or 100 sources, make sure to stop gathering sources, and instead use the `complete_sub_task` tool immediately. Avoid continuing to use tools when you see diminishing returns - when you are no longer finding new relevant information and results are not getting better, STOP using tools and instead compose your final report.\n</maximum_tool_call_limit>\n\n<output_format>\nYour output should be a sub-report that answer all of the questions and requests of the Lead agent's request. It MUST be a detailed sub-report on the specific area assigned to you by the lead research. For the facts that you used `web_fetch`, you MUST include the source that you usde for that fact. However, your output MUST be a report, not a list of sources and just facts from those sources.\n</output_format>\n\nFollow the <research_process> and the <research_guidelines> above to accomplish the task, making sure to parallelize tool calls for maximum efficiency. Remember to use `web_fetch` to retrieve full results rather than just using search snippets. Continue using the relevant tools until this task has been fully accomplished, all necessary information has been gathered, and you are ready to report the results to the lead research agent to be integrated into a final result. You should do your best to thoroughly accomplish the your task. No clarifications will be given, therefore use your best judgment and DO NOT attempt to ask the user question.\n\nAs soon as you have the necessary information, complete the task rather than wasting time by continuing research unnecessarily. As soon as the task is done, immediately use the `complete_sub_task` tool to finish and provide your detailed, condensed, complete, accurate report to the lead researcher. If you reach the system-enforced step limit before finishing, stop and call `complete_sub_task` right away rather than ending without a report. This report must be detailed as it will be used for a research paper. DO NOT have any follow ups or reccomendations for next steps in your final repsonse. You MUST only return your detailed final report."

Chapter 301, NHTSA is charged with authority “to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries resulting from traffic accidents.” 49 U.S.C. § 30101. To carry out this statutory mandate, NHTSA has broad information gathering authority, including authority to obtain information on vehicle crashes, potential defects related to motor vehicle safety, and compliance 1 See 49 CFR §§ 1.95, 501.8(d)(3) (delegations of authority). 2 This action does not affect the enforceability of NHTSA’s June 29, 2021 Standing General Order 2021-01, August 12, 2021 First Amended Standing General Order 2021-01, or April 5, 2023 Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01. NHTSA will continue to evaluate crashes reported pursuant to prior versions of this General Order and may take enforcement actions as appropriate, including to address failures to report timely, fully, or truthfully under prior versions of the General Order. 2 with legal requirements to timely identify and conduct recalls for safety defects. See 49 U.S.C. § 30166(e), (g); 49 CFR Part 510; see also 49 U.S.C. §§ 30118-30120. Both Automated Driving Systems (ADS) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are “motor vehicle equipment” subject to the requirements of the Safety Act. See id. § 30102(8). Given the rapid evolution of these technologies and testing of new technologies and features on publicly accessible roads, it is critical for NHTSA to exercise its robust oversight over potential safety defects in vehicles operating with ADS and Level 2 ADAS.3 Through this action, NHTSA will evaluate whether specific manufacturers (including manufacturers of prototype vehicles and equipment) are meeting their statutory obligations to ensure that their vehicles and equipment are free of defects that pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety or are recalled if such a safety defect is identified. See 49 U.S.C. §§ 30112, 30118-30120. NHTSA’s oversight of potential safety defects in vehicles operating on publicly accessible roads using ADS or Level 2 ADAS requires that NHTSA have timely information on incidents involving those vehicle systems. In carrying out the Safety Act, NHTSA may “require, by general or special order, any person to file reports or answers to specific questions.” Id. § 30166(g)(1)(A). As set forth below, NHTSA is requiring manufacturers of ADS and Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles, ADS and Level 2 ADAS equipment manufacturers, and operators of ADS-equipped vehicles to report specified information about certain safety-related incidents involving vehicles (including prototype vehicles) operating on publicly accessible roads using 3 For a description of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) levels of driving automation, see SAE J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automation Systems for On-Road Motor Vehicles (April 2021); https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety#topic-road-self-driving. In this General Order, the term “Level 2 ADAS” is used to refer to partial driving automation systems. 3 ADS or Level 2 ADAS and to provide sufficient information for NHTSA to identify crashes warranting further follow-up. The requirements of this General Order are informed by NHTSA’s implementation of prior versions of the General Order. This General Order revises certain requirements from prior versions that maintain the safety benefits of reporting while reducing unnecessary burdens. Individual manufacturers and operators will be served with this General Order, which triggers the entity’s legal obligations to report crashes as required by the General Order. NHTSA’s oversight is not limited to the information collected through this General Order, and NHTSA will consider all information relevant to potential safety defects, including information regarding non-crash incidents, and may open defect investigations as warranted.

AUTOMATED VEHICLES Report to Congress Automated Vehicles The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (H.R. 2617; Pub. L. 117-328), enacted on December 29, 2022,1 requests the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to provide a status report of current research and rulemakings related to automated vehicles.2 Specifically, as noted in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Act,3 NHTSA is requested “to submit a report within 90 days of enactment of this act on the status of current research and rulemakings related to the safe deployment of new automated vehicles (AV) technology that may improve safety outcomes, and incorporate novel vehicle designs that improve mobility and access for all.” Introduction Safety is the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) and NHTSA’s top priority. On January 27, 2022, the DOT announced its comprehensive National Roadway Safety Strategy4 for addressing the national crisis in roadway fatalities and serious injuries. Later that year, the DOT also released its Innovation Principles5 that emphasize investment in purpose-driven research and innovation to meet the challenges of the present and modernize a transportation system of the future. This document provides the status of NHTSA’s ongoing innovative research and rulemaking activities related to the safe deployment of new AV technology as requested in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the FY 23 Consolidated Appropriations Act. NHTSA develops annual research plans and budgets as part of a broader coordinated planning effort within the Department and as required by Congress. These annual plans are published as Annual Modal Research Plans (AMRPs),6 which are mandated in Sec. 6501 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act.7 AMRPs are developed each year to describe upcoming plans for agency safety research, including descriptions of research program areas, consistent with those described in annual budget requests contained in the President’s budget. AMRPs and annual budget requests are closely coordinated between NHTSA program offices, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, and other operating administrations within DOT including: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research & Technology— including their Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office and Highly Automated Systems Safety (HASS) Center of Excellence— Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy, Office of the Chief Financial Officer and Assistant 1 https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617. 2 Throughout this report, NHTSA uses the term Automated Driving System (ADS) as defined in SAE International (SAE) J3016, “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems,” April 2021. A vehicle equipped with a SAE driving automation Level 4-5 ADS is also commonly referred to as an Automated Vehicle (AV). This report does not consider vehicle technologies that can be classified as SAE driving automation Levels 0-2, which are types of advanced driver assistance systems. 3 https://www.congress.gov/117/crec/2022/12/20/168/198/CREC-2022-12-20-pt3-PgS9325-2.pdf. 4 USDOT National Roadway Safety Strategy. 5 USDOT Innovation Principles. 6 https://www.transportation.gov/administrations/assistant-secretary-research-and-technology/rdt-annual-modal-research-plans. 7 Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act. Secretary for Budget and Programs, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, Maritime Administration, and Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway. Among the vehicle safety research programs described in recent AMRPs are the Automated Driving Systems (ADS) and Vehicle Electronics and Cybersecurity programs. Many of the research projects in these programs focus on SAE International (SAE) driving automation Levels 3-5 or ADS. Aligned with the research program descriptions included in the AMRP documents, the following are the main categories of ADS research program areas: 1. System Safety Performance 2.

In the summer of 2017, the Uber Advanced Technologies Group approached the RAND Corporation to request help in crafting a framework for measuring AV safety that could aid in public discussion of the issues. This project builds on previous RAND research into AV trends and related public policy. Whereas prior work has addressed issues broadly and analytically, this project has looked more closely at what companies that are key to the evolution of AVs have been doing to foster and evaluate the safety of those vehicles. The report is intended for a broad public audience. In this report, we develop a framework for measuring safety in AVs that could be used broadly by companies, policymakers, and the public. We considered how to define safety for AVs, how to measure safety for AVs, and how to communicate what is learned or understood about AVs. Given AVs’ limited total on-road mileage compared with conventional vehicles, we consider options for proxy measurements—i.e., factors that might be correlated with safety. We also explore how safety measurements could be made in simulation and on closed courses. The closely held nature of AV data limits the details of what is made public or shared between companies and with the government. The report focuses on identifying key concepts and illuminating the kinds of measurements that might be made and communicated. The research reported here was conducted in two programs. The RAND Science, Technology, and Policy program focuses primarily on the role of scientific development and technological innovation in human behavior, global and regional decisionmaking as it relates to science and technology, and the concurrent effects that science and technology have on policy analysis and policy choices. The program covers such topics as space exploration, information and telecommunication technologies, and nano- and biotechnologies. The RAND Justice Policy Program spans both criminal and civil justice system issues with such topics as public safety, effective policing, police–community relations, drug policy and enforcement, corrections policy, use of technology in law enforcement, tort reform, catastrophe and mass-injury compensation, court resourcing, and insurance regulation. Research in both programs is supported by government agencies, foundations, and the private sector. RAND Justice, Infrastructure, and Environment (JIE) conducts research and analysis in civil and criminal justice, infrastructure development and financing, environmental policy, transportation planning and technology, immigration and border protection, public and occupational safety, energy policy, science and innovation policy, space, telecommunications, and trends and implications of artificial intelligence and other computational technologies.

On April 2, [California expanded its testing rules](https://www.wired.com/story/california-self-driving-car-laws/) to allow for remote monitoring instead of a safety driver inside the vehicle. Waymo and another company have since [applied to begin testing vehicles without drivers](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Exclusive-Waymo-appplies-for-no-driver-testing-12832425.php) in the state. While neighboring states Arizona and Nevada also allow testing without a safety driver, California is both the most populous state and also the home to many of the companies’ testing vehicles. States should learn from regulations that promote innovation and safety at the same time.\n\n## **Setbacks in Autonomous Vehicle testing**\n\nAn Uber vehicle with a safety driver [struck and killed a pedestrian](https://www.abc15.com/news/region-southeast-valley/tempe/tempe-police-investigating-self-driving-uber-car-involved-in-crash-overnight) in Tempe, Arizona on March 18; Uber quickly suspended all testing of its autonomous fleet while it investigates the causes of the crash. On March 23, the driver of a Tesla in autonomous mode died when the vehicle [crashed into a highway median](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/30/tesla-autopilot-was-on-during-deadly-mountain-view-crash/) in Mountain View, California. Tesla has not suspended the feature in its vehicles while the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigate the causes of that crash. Since proponents highlight the safety improvements of driverless cars, these fatalities will invite stricter scrutiny of the claims of the technology.\n\nAs their name implies, safety drivers have played an important role in autonomous vehicle development. They receive special training to assume control when onboard computers encounter a situation that the vehicle cannot navigate by itself. Driving conditions can change quickly and the safety driver must remain alert constantly. However, advancements in driverless technology promise to eliminate human inputs altogether. With no steering wheel or a gas pedal, a computer would control the engine and steering based on inputs from onboard sensors. Passenger shuttles without any of these features have launched in [Las Vegas](https://calstate.aaa.com/lp/hopon), the [University of Michigan](https://mcity.umich.edu/shuttle/), and in [San Ramon, California](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-driverless-buses-start-rolling-this-month-san-ramon/).\n\n## **A look at state laws**\n\nWhile the U.S. Department of Transportation and NHTSA periodically update their [guidelines for autonomous vehicles](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf), individual states are already passing relevant laws. However, they differ on basics like the definition of “vehicle operator.” [Tennessee SB 151](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/110/Bill/SB0151.pdf) points to the autonomous driving system (ADS), while [Texas SB 2205](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB2205/2017) designates a “natural person” riding in the vehicle. Meanwhile, [Georgia SB 219](http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20172018/SB/219) identifies the operator as the person who causes the ADS to engage, which might happen remotely in a vehicle fleet. These distinctions will affect how states license both human drivers and autonomous vehicles going forward.\n\nThe most popular topic, with 11 state laws, is exemptions to following distance rules that allow for [truck platooning](http://news.mit.edu/2016/driverless-truck-platoons-save-time-fuel-1221). Drivers typically maintain an appropriate following distance from other vehicles to account for speed, road conditions, and human reaction times when traffic comes to a stop. With wireless communication, a line of trucks can acc\n\n[Content truncated due to length...]\n\n**Failed Extractions:**\n- https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-132.pdf: Failed to fetch content",

While the General Order also covers vehicles equipped with SAE Levels 3-5 Automated Driving Systems (ADS), that data summary is provided in a separate report. The General Order requires that reporting entities file incident reports for crashes involving Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles that occur on publicly accessible roads in the United States and its territories. Crashes involving a Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicle are reportable if the Level 2 ADAS was in use at any time within 30 seconds of the crash and the crash involved a vulnerable road user2 or resulted in a fatality, a vehicle tow-away, an air bag deployment, or any individual being transported to a hospital for medical treatment. NHTSA issued the General Order on June 29, 2021, and received the first ADAS incident report on July 20, 2021. As of May 15, 2022, NHTSA has received incident reports for 392 Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicle crashes. Prior to the implementation of the General Order, NHTSA’s sources of timely crash notifications were limited (e.g., media, vehicle owner questionnaire input, voluntary direct company outreach, and Early Warning Reporting) and generally inconsistent across manufacturers, including developers. The General Order allows NHTSA to obtain timely and transparent notification of real-world crashes associated with Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles from manufacturers and operators. With these data, NHTSA can respond to crashes that raise safety concerns about ADAS technologies through further investigation and enforcement. As an example, the General Order has provided the agency information on specific crashes of ADAS-equipped vehicles. NHTSA has followed up with several manufacturers to acquire more data on these crashes, and this information has informed an ongoing investigation the agency opened on a driver assistance system in late 2021. The information also provides transparency into the safety of vehicles equipped with this technology that are currently operating on public roads. It also provides crucial data necessary for research and for the development of policies to enhance the safety of these technologies. Safety is crucial to the deployment and public acceptance of new technologies and the General Order is an important measure in evaluating the safety of ADAS and ADS technology. Data and Limitations Understanding the terms and requirements of the General Order, the data it aims to obtain, and the limitations of those data are crucial for accurate interpretation and analysis. The following should be considered when reviewing these data and other information. 1 For a description of the SAE International (SAE) levels of driving automation, see SAE J3016, “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automation Systems for On-Road Motor Vehicles,” April 2021. 2 “Vulnerable Road User” includes any person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle with more than three wheels. This definition includes, but is not limited to, pedestrians, people traveling in wheelchairs, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and riders or occupants of other transport vehicles that are not motor vehicles, such as all-terrain vehicles and tractors. Access to Crash Data May Affect Crash Reporting Crash data recording and telemetry capabilities may vary widely by manufacturer and driving automation system. Many Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles may be limited in their capabilities to record data related to driving automation system engagement and crash circumstances. The vehicle’s ability to remotely transmit this data to the manufacturer for notification purposes can also widely vary. Furthermore, Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles are generally privately owned; as a result, when a reportable crash does occur, manufacturers may not know of it unless contacted by the vehicle owner. These limitations are important to keep in mind when reviewing the Summary Incident Report Data. Manufacturers of Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles with limited data recording and telemetry capabilities may only receive consumer reports of driving automation system involvement in a crash outcome, and there may be a time delay before the manufacturer is notified, if the manufacturer is notified at all. In general, timeliness of the General Order reporting is dependent on if and when the manufact\n\n[Content truncated due to length...]\n\n**Content from https://azdot.gov/mvd/services/professional-services/autonomous-vehicles-testing-and-operating-state-arizona:**\n* [MVD Home](/mvd)\n* [Services](/mvd/services)\n* [MVD Locations](/mvd/mvd-hours-and-locations)\n* [FAQ](/mvd/mvd-faq)\n* [Contact Us](/mvd/contact-mvd)\n\n\n* [Online Services](/motor-vehicles/online-services)\n* [ADOT](/home)\n\n\n* [Careers](https://azdot.gov/about/careers-adot \"Careers with ADOT\")\n* [Quick Registration Renewal](https://azmvdnow.gov/guest/customeranonymous/titleregistration/registrationrenewal/search/vehicle)\n* [Visit AZMVDNow.gov](https://azmvdnow.gov/)\n* [Fast facts](/mvd/fast-facts)\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n1.

Waymo and Cruise were the leaders in AV testing in California and account for over 78% of the 32 million miles driven through 2024including drivered and driverless AV miles. The next figure shows three data points for Waymo, Zoox and Cruise: drivered AV miles, driverless AV miles and total AV miles. The two companies accounted for over 93% of all disengagements with less than 1% of AV testing miles.\n",

The investigation shows \n\nthat technologies that seek to automate tasks traditionally performed by drivers are becoming an \n\nincreasing part of NHTSA ’s safety oversight. \n\nTraditional veh icles powered by gasoline and diesel engines with human drivers have been regulated by \n\nNHTSA for over 50 years. During that time, many types of vehicle defects have been addressed and \n\nmillions of vehicles have been recalled for safety -related modifications at the manufacturers ’ expense . In \n\n2020 alone , nearly 900 recalls  of vehicles and parts were issued, affecting nearly 55 million vehicles .\n\nBecause of the widespread use of computers, sensors , and other automated technologies in vehicles, cars \n\nare increasingly referred to as “computers on wheels .” The current shortage of semiconductor s highlights \n\nthe dependence of motor vehicles on electronics, which are used in a wide variety of applic ations, \n\nincluding airbags, emission sensors, engines , and media displays. By forcing vehicle and parts \n\nmanufacturers to scale back production, t he semiconductor shortage has reduced the availability of cars in \n\ndealers ’ lots and driven up prices:  the average new vehicle trans action price is nearly $42,000 —a $6,000 \n\nincrease from August 2020 prices for comparable vehicles. \n\nIn light of the computeriza tion of motor vehicles, NHTSA will increasingly be faced with the need to \n\nevaluate the safety impact of electronics -based technologies. The recently announced Tesla investigation \n\nis to evaluate its Autopilot —an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that is thought to have been \n\ninvolved in 11 crashes in nine states. Seventeen injuries and one death resulted from these incidents. The \n\ninquiry could ultimately affect more than 700,000 Tesla electric vehicles, including Models 3, S, X, and \n\nY. \n\nAutopilot is Tesla ’s name for a technology that maintains a vehicle ’s speed through cruise control, \n\nensures lane centering , and enables self -parking, along with other features. Other automakers have similar \n\nsystems . Despite the name Tesla has applied to its ADAS , its vehicles do not operate autonomously; they \n\nmust still be monitored and ultimately controlled by the driver, who must intervene when necessary to \n\nidentify obstacles in the road ahead or change the drive path based on actions taken by nearby vehicles. It \n\napp ears, however, that some Tesla drivers believe their vehicles can drive themselves with little or no \n\nhuman involvement. NHTSA ’s preliminary investigation  is to “assess the technolo gies and methods used \n\nCongressional Research Service \n\nhttps://crsreports.congress.gov \n\nIN11749 Congressional Research Service 2\n\nto monitor, assist, and enforce the driver ’s engagement ” with Autopilot and also is to examine \n\ncircumstances surrounding each of the 11 designated crashes , each of which involved a first responder \n\nvehicle. \n\nTesla ’s vehicles fall into the Level 2 category of automation, under a classification system developed by \n\nSAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers). The SAE system , which has been \n\nadopted by NHTSA  and other safety regulators, categorizes vehicle automation based on the amount of \n\ndriver intervention and attention required to safely drive the vehicle: Level 0 requires full driver control of \n\nthe vehic le ; Level 5 , which has not been achieved by any highway vehicle in commercial production, \n\nwould require no human intervention at all . Newer vehicles on the roads today are generally categorized \n\nas Level 2, with partial automation for steering and acceleration, but with a human driver executing most \n\ndriving functions. An August 2021 NHTSA sta tement  confirmed the current state of vehicle automation: \n\n“NHTSA reminds the public that no commercially available motor vehicles today are capable of driving \n\nthemselves. Every available vehicle requires a human driver to be in control at all times, and al l State \n\nlaws hold human drivers responsible for operation of their vehicles .” \n\nThe  National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) , an independent agency that investigates transportation \n\naccidents and reco mmends steps to avoid similar incidents, has  issued reports  on several fatal Tesla \n\ncrashes, including those in Mountain View, C A, in 2 018 and Delray Beach, F L, in 2019. Regardin g the \n\nCalifornia crash, NTSB ’s final report noted that “contributing to the crash was the operational design of \n\nTesla ’s partial automation system ... and the company ’s failure to limit the use of the system to the \n\nconditions for which it was designed. ” NTS B reached a similar conc\n\n[Content truncated due to length...]\n\n**Failed Extractions:**\n- https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-132.pdf: Failed to fetch content",
