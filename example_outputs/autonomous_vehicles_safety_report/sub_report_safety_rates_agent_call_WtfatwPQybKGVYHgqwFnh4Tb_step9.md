Sub-report: AV vs Human crash/injury/fatality rates per VMT (Jan 1, 2018 – Sep 30, 2025) — urban North America (San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, Toronto, Phoenix)

1) Definitions (used throughout)
- Vehicle-mile traveled (VMT): total miles driven by the vehicle(s) measured by odometer/GPS/vehicle telemetry. Rate convention used here: incidents per million vehicle-miles traveled (IPMM) = (number of incidents / VMT) * 1,000,000.
- Metrics and severity categories used in sources and in this report:
  - Property-damage-only (PDO): crash reported with property damage and no reported injury.
  - Any-injury-reported crash: police or official report indicates at least one injured person (any severity).
  - Serious-injury-or-worse: crash with serious injury (hospitalization) or fatality.
  - Fatality: crash resulting in one or more deaths (FARS/NHTSA definitions where applicable).

2) Key quantitative results (table of rates). Notes: where possible I report multiple independent source values for the same metric (different datasets / periods). All rates are incidents per million vehicle miles (IPMM). "AV" entries primarily reflect driverless/"rider-only" (RO) ADS operations (Waymo); other AVs have much smaller/publicly limited exposure and are indicated separately. "Human benchmark" uses the human-surface-street benchmark used by Waymo (city-specific police/VMT-based benchmarks) and, where noted, national NHTSA rates for context.

Table (selected metrics; city / period shown):
- Any-injury-reported crash rate (IPMM):
  - AV (Waymo rider-only, combined locations through June 2025): 0.80 IPMM [1].
  - AV (Waymo rider-only, 7.14M miles through Oct 2023; peer-reviewed analysis): 0.41 IPMM [2].
  - Human benchmark (Waymo city surface-street benchmark, combined locations): 3.96 IPMM [1].
  - Human benchmark (alternative peer-reviewed benchmark used in Kusano et al. paper): 2.80 IPMM [2].
  - Context (national injured-persons rate from NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts 2023): 75 injured persons per 100M VMT = 0.75 injured persons per M VMT (note: injured persons vs crash events differ in definition) [7].
  - Cities/data period: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin — AV data through June 2025 (Waymo hub); Kusano et al. 7.14M miles through Oct 2023 [1][2].
  - Sources (minimum two independent): Waymo Safety Impact data hub [1]; Kusano et al. peer-reviewed study / Waymo research paper (Traffic Injury Prevention) [2]; NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts (national context) [7].

- Serious-injury-or-worse crash rate (IPMM):
  - AV (Waymo combined): 0.02 IPMM [1].
  - Human benchmark (Waymo combined): 0.23 IPMM [1].
  - Kusano et al. (7.14M miles) report statistically significant reductions in serious-injury-class outcomes for combined locations (ADS 0.41 any-injury; police-reported crash rates 2.1 vs 4.68 for human benchmark — see paper for which outcome each refers to) [2].
  - Cities/data period: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin; Waymo hub through June 2025; Kusano et al. through Oct 2023 [1][2].
  - Sources: Waymo Safety Impact [1]; Kusano et al. peer-reviewed study [2].

- Airbag-deployment / police-reportable / property-damage proxies (IPMM):
  - Airbag-deployment crashes (Waymo combined): 0.35 IPMM vs benchmark 1.65 IPMM [1].
  - Police-reportable crashed-vehicle rate (Kusano et al., ADS 7.14M): 2.1 IPMM for ADS vs 4.68 IPMM benchmark (police-reportable crashes) [2].
  - Sources: Waymo hub [1]; Kusano et al. [2].

- Fatalities (IPMM):
  - AV (Waymo rider-only): reported fatal crashes are extremely rare/zero in the Waymo rider-only public datasets used for the analyses above (Waymo reports serious-injury-or-worse 0.02 IPMM; counting of fatalities specifically in RO miles over the analyzed periods shows zero fatal crashes attributable to Waymo RO operations in the published Waymo analyses) [1][2].
  - Human context (national): 1.26 fatalities per 100M VMT in 2023 = 0.0126 fatalities per M VMT [7].
  - Note: the Uber Tempe pedestrian fatality (Mar 2018) is a high-profile AV-involved fatality in the U.S. testing era; it is an example of a testing fatality within the 2018–2025 window but represents a single event from early-stage testing and is widely documented in NHTSA records and news reporting (not used to compute fleet-level IPMM above) [6][3].
  - Sources: Waymo hub and Kusano et al. (Waymo dataset) [1][2]; NHTSA national fatality statistics [7]; NHTSA press materials and SGO dataset and California DMV incident reports for individual AV fatality coverage [6][3].

3) Narrative summary of findings, uncertainties, and gaps
- Main quantitative finding (based on available public, city-level driverless ADS data): Waymo’s publicly shared rider-only (driverless) crash rates (measured as incidents per million miles) are substantially lower than the human-surface-street benchmarks in the same urban areas for multiple outcomes (any-injury-reported crashes, serious-injury-or-worse, airbag-deployment and police-reportable crash rates). Example figures: Waymo any-injury-reported combined = 0.80 IPMM vs human benchmark 3.96 IPMM (Waymo hub, through June 2025) [1]; Kusano et al. peer-reviewed comparison on a smaller but independent dataset (7.14M miles through Oct 2023) found ADS any-injury-reported rate 0.41 IPMM vs a human benchmark of 2.80 IPMM (statistically significant reductions reported) [2]. Both the Waymo dashboard and the Kusano et al. paper report statistical uncertainty and confidence intervals for their estimates; Waymo provides 95% CIs on its IPMM estimates in the Safety Impact hub and Kusano et al. report significance testing and CI methodology in the peer-reviewed paper [1][2].

- Important caveats and uncertainty:
  - Exposure (VMT) differences: AV fleets today (2018–2025) have driven orders of magnitude fewer miles in public driverless operations than the human-driven vehicle fleet. Waymo’s RO exposure (96M RO miles through June 2025 per Waymo’s hub) is large by AV standards but small relative to total urban VMT; the sample sizes for other AV operators are much smaller or not publicly reported, reducing precision for cross-fleet comparisons [1][5]. Use of per-mile normalization reduces but does not eliminate concerns about representativeness of where and how AV miles are driven (e.g., constrained operating design domains, route selection, speed and time-of-day limits).
  - Definition and reporting differences: sources differ in exact outcome definitions ("any injury reported" vs police-reported crashes vs airbag deployments vs severity levels). Waymo’s benchmark methodology adjusts for location and exposure and is documented on the Waymo Safety Impact hub; Kusano et al. provide a peer-reviewed method for benchmarking; national NHTSA tables use different sampling (CRSS/FARS) and report person-level counts. Direct apples-to-apples matching across all datasets is therefore imperfect; where possible I present the officially reported IPMM values and note definition differences [1][2][7].
  - Potential reporting bias and completeness: NHTSA’s Standing General Order (SGO) requires reporting from ADS/ADAS manufacturers and operators, and NHTSA publishes SGO incident CSV files — but compliance and completeness have been topics of regulatory enforcement (e.g., NHTSA consent order with Cruise for incomplete reporting), and SGO files themselves are incident-level reports (not aggregated rates) [6][9]. California DMV requires AV companies to submit collision and mileage/disengagement reports; these are essential but do not capture private testing miles outside the reporting period/region and may not be fully standardized across operators [3][5]. The Cruise consent-order action shows regulators have found incomplete reporting in industry submissions, which increases uncertainty when aggregating cross-company results [8][9].
  - Small-number effects: many operators have driven very small driverless VMT totals, producing wide confidence intervals and in many cases rates that are not statistically distinguishable from human benchmarks; Waymo’s larger exposure yields tighter CIs and statistically significant reductions in several outcomes, but this is largely a Waymo-specific result to date [1][2].

- Other AV operators / jurisdictional notes:
  - California DMV publishes collision reports and annual mileage/disengagement CSVs for AV testers/deployers; these show that multiple companies test/deploy in California but with widely varying mileage totals — the DMV reported a record ~9 million test miles among permit holders in one 12-month period (Feb 2024 release), and the DMV’s collision-report pages list the detailed incident PDFs; these data are essential for cross-company counting but must be aggregated carefully and combined with exposure to derive IPMM rates [4][3][5].
  - NHTSA SGO provides incident-level public CSVs with reports submitted under the SGO; the dataset is a required regulatory record and is useful for counting reported incidents by reporting entity, but it does not by itself contain consolidated exposure (miles) per operator. Analyses that combine SGO incident counts with operator mileage disclosures (e.g., company transparency reports or state DMV mileage reports) are necessary to compute IPMM for other operators; those combined computations require careful matching and often are not available in a standardized form for every company [6][9].
  - Cruise: regulatory actions (NHTSA consent order) document incomplete reporting for some incidents; Cruise’s data and reporting history therefore have additional uncertainty, complicating cross-fleet rate comparisons [8]. California DMV collision PDFs list many incidents reported by Cruise and other operators; however, exposure (miles) for Cruise’s driverless operations is less consistently published than Waymo’s, so robust IPMM estimates for Cruise are not presently reproducible from public sources without additional data [3][5][8].
  - Toronto (Canada): at present there is limited public driverless-ADS rider-only VMT in Toronto available to compute robust AV IPMMs. The City of Toronto produces analyses of ride-hail and PTC vehicle collision rates per vehicle-kilometre — e.g., PTC collisions were reported as ~3.8 collisions per 10 million km for a recent multi-year period (2020–2023) — but those figures cover human-driven platform vehicles, not driverless AVs; they are provided here for local context only and show the difficulty of obtaining true driverless-ADS exposure data in many Canadian municipalities [10].

4) Main limitations and recommended interpretation
- The strongest, most-robust AV vs human rate comparisons to date come from Waymo’s rider-only datasets (large exposure, transparent methodology) and independent peer-reviewed analyses of those datasets; results from other AV operators are limited by small exposure, variable transparency, and known reporting-completeness issues in some cases (NHTSA enforcement actions). Therefore fleet-level statements that generalize across all AV operators should be made with caution.
- Numerical head-to-head comparisons reported here rely on the explicit definitions and measurement choices made by the cited sources; differences in those definitions (e.g., crash event vs injured person) are noted and can materially affect direct numeric equivalence.

5) Short, neutral conclusion (facts-only)
- For the cities and period where large driverless-ADS exposure exists (Waymo rider-only operations in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin), publicly reported IPMM rates for multiple outcomes (any-injury-reported crashes, police-reportable crashes, airbag deployments, and serious-injury-or-worse) are numerically lower for Waymo’s rider-only operations than the human-surface-street benchmarks used in the same geographies and periods. This finding is supported by Waymo’s Safety Impact hub (which reports IPMM and 95% CIs) and an independent peer-reviewed analysis of Waymo RO data (Kusano et al., Traffic Injury Prevention) [1][2].
- For other AV operators and for driverless operations in many North American cities (including Toronto), publicly available driverless-ADS exposure is much smaller or not reported in a standardized way; this produces large uncertainty and prevents robust, generalizable per-VMT rate estimates for those operators/locations at present. Regulatory datasets (NHTSA SGO incident reports, California DMV collision/mileage reports) are essential for cross-checking but require careful aggregation and may be affected by incomplete reporting for some operators (documented enforcement action vs Cruise) [3][5][6][8][9].

7) Final notes for lead researcher
- I used official public sources (Waymo Safety Impact hub, Waymo peer-reviewed research paper, California DMV collision and mileage/disengagement files, NHTSA SGO and Traffic Safety Facts tables, NHTSA press releases). For the strongest AV-vs-human per-VMT comparisons available in the requested urban cities/timeframe, the most robust public exposure-plus-incident datasets and methods are those produced and published by Waymo and the independent peer-reviewed analyses of those data. Other operators’ exposures are smaller and/or incompletely reported publicly; NHTSA enforcement actions have documented incomplete reporting by at least one major operator (Cruise), which increases uncertainty for cross-fleet aggregation. Please incorporate these references and the caveats above when integrating this sub-report into the larger research product.
