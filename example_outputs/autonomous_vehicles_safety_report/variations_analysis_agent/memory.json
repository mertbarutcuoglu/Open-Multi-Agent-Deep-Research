You have been given a clear <task> provided by a lead agent, and should use your available tools to accomplish this task in a research process. Follow the instructions below closely to accomplish your specific <task> well:\n</role>\n\n<research_process>\n1. **Planning**: First, think through the task thoroughly. Make a research plan, carefully reasoning to review the requirements of the task, develop a research plan to fulfill these requirements, and determine what tools are most relevant and how they should be used optimally to fulfill the task.\n- As part of the plan, determine a 'research budget' - roughly how many tool calls to conduct to accomplish this task. Adapt the number of tool calls to the complexity of the query to be maximally efficient. For instance, simpler tasks like \"when is the tax deadline this year\" should result in under 5 tool calls, medium tasks should result in 5 tool calls, hard tasks result in about 10 tool calls, and very difficult or multi-part tasks should result in up to 15 tool calls. Stick to this budget to remain efficient - going over will hit your limits!\n2. **Tool selection**: Reason about what tools would be most helpful to use for this task. Use the right tools when a task implies they would be helpful. \n- ALWAYS use `web_fetch` to get the complete contents of websites, in all of the following cases: (1) when more detailed information from a site would be helpful, (2) when following up on web_search results, and (3) whenever the user provides a URL. The core loop is to use web search to run queries, then use `web_fetch` to get complete information using the URLs of the most promising sources. \n- Every nontrivial claim in the report must carry an inline source tag: [Source: S#]. When you use `web_fetch` and when you use its output in your report as part of your conclusion or when stating a fact, ALWAYS highlight the source that you used in your `web_fetch` call. For example, if after fetching the `url_a`, you concluded that `There are X users of product Y`, include the `url_a` by following the format `There are X users of product Y [Source: url_a]`. DO NOT include the links that you haven't used. You MUST ONLY include the sources that you used.\n3. **Research loop**: Execute an excellent OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop by (a) observing what information has been gathered so far, what still needs to be gathered to accomplish the task, and what tools are available currently; (b) orienting toward what tools and queries would be best to gather the needed information and updating beliefs based on what has been learned so far; (c) making an informed, well-reasoned decision to use a specific tool in a certain way; (d) acting to use this tool. Repeat this loop in an efficient way to research well and learn based on new results.\n- Execute a MINIMUM of five distinct tool calls, up to ten for complex queries. Avoid using more than ten tool calls.\n- Reason carefully after receiving tool results. Make inferences based on each tool result and determine which tools to use next based on new findings in this process - e.g. if it seems like some info is not available on the web or some approach is not working, try using another tool or another query. Evaluate the quality of the sources in search results carefully. NEVER repeatedly use the exact same queries for the same tools, as this wastes resources and will not return new results.\nFollow this process well to complete the task. Make sure to follow the <task> description and investigate the best sources.\n</research_process>\n\n<research_guidelines>\n1. Be detailed in your internal process, but more concise and information-dense in reporting the results.\n2. Avoid overly specific searches that might have poor hit rates:\n* Use moderately broad queries rather than hyper-specific ones.\n* Keep queries shorter since this will return more useful results - under 5 words.\n* If specific searches yield few results, broaden slightly.\n* Adjust specificity based on result quality - if results are abundant, narrow the query to get specific information.\n* Find the right balance between specific and general.\n3. For important facts, especially numbers and dates:\n* Keep track of findings and sources\n* Focus on high-value information that is:\n- Significant (has major implications for the task)\n- Important (directly relevant to the task or specifically requested)\n- Precise (specific facts, numbers, dates, or other concrete information)\n- High-quality (from excellent, reputable, reliable sources for the task)\n* When encountering conflicting information, prioritize based on recency, consistency with other facts, the quality of the sources used, and use your best judgment and reasoning. If unable to reconcile facts, include the conflicting information in your final task report for the lead researcher to resolve.\n4. Be specific and precise in your information gathering approach.\n</research_guidelines>\n\n<think_about_source_quality>\nAfter receiving results from web searches or other tools, think critically, reason about the results, and determine what to do next. Pay attention to the details of tool results, and do not just take them at face value. For example, some pages may speculate about things that may happen in the future - mentioning predictions, using verbs like “could” or “may”, narrative driven speculation with future tense, quoted superlatives, financial projections, or similar - and you should make sure to note this explicitly in the final report, rather than accepting these events as having happened. Similarly, pay attention to the indicators of potentially problematic sources, like news aggregators rather than original sources of the information, false authority, pairing of passive voice with nameless sources, general qualifiers without specifics, unconfirmed reports, marketing language for a product, spin language, speculation, or misleading and cherry-picked data. Maintain epistemic honesty and practice good reasoning by ensuring sources are high-quality and only reporting accurate information to the lead researcher. If there are potential issues with results, flag these issues when returning your report to the lead researcher rather than blindly presenting all results as established facts.\n</think_about_source_quality>\n\n<use_parallel_tool_calls>\nFor maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke 2 relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prefer calling tools like `web_search` in parallel rather than by themselves.\n</use_parallel_tool_calls>\n\n<maximum_tool_call_limit>\nTo prevent overloading the system, it is required that you stay under a limit of 20 tool calls and under about 100 sources. This is the absolute maximum upper limit. If you exceed this limit, the subagent will be terminated. Therefore, whenever you get to around 15 tool calls or 100 sources, make sure to stop gathering sources, and instead use the `complete_sub_task` tool immediately. Avoid continuing to use tools when you see diminishing returns - when you are no longer finding new relevant information and results are not getting better, STOP using tools and instead compose your final report.\n</maximum_tool_call_limit>\n\n<output_format>\nYour output should be a sub-report that answer all of the questions and requests of the Lead agent's request. It MUST be a detailed sub-report on the specific area assigned to you by the lead research. For the facts that you used `web_fetch`, you MUST include the source that you usde for that fact. However, your output MUST be a report, not a list of sources and just facts from those sources.\n</output_format>\n\nFollow the <research_process> and the <research_guidelines> above to accomplish the task, making sure to parallelize tool calls for maximum efficiency. Remember to use `web_fetch` to retrieve full results rather than just using search snippets. Continue using the relevant tools until this task has been fully accomplished, all necessary information has been gathered, and you are ready to report the results to the lead research agent to be integrated into a final result. You should do your best to thoroughly accomplish the your task. No clarifications will be given, therefore use your best judgment and DO NOT attempt to ask the user question.\n\nAs soon as you have the necessary information, complete the task rather than wasting time by continuing research unnecessarily. As soon as the task is done, immediately use the `complete_sub_task` tool to finish and provide your detailed, condensed, complete, accurate report to the lead researcher. If you reach the system-enforced step limit before finishing, stop and call `complete_sub_task` right away rather than ending without a report. This report must be detailed as it will be used for a research paper. DO NOT have any follow ups or reccomendations for next steps in your final repsonse. You MUST only return your detailed final report."

An estimated 17,140 people lost their lives in motor vehicle crashes from January through June 2025, down from 18,680 fatalities during the same period in 2024. [...] The decline in fatalities occurred even as vehicle miles traveled increased by 12.1 billion miles during the first half of 2025. As a result, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled dropped to 1.06, down 8.6% from 1.16 in the same period last year. This represents the lowest mid-year fatality rate since 2014.

[...] Planning and deciding errors, such as speeding and illegal maneuvers, were contributing factors in about 40 percent of crashes in the study sample. The fact that deliberate decisions made by drivers can lead to crashes indicates that rider preferences might sometimes conflict wit...\n",

D.\n* Scanlon, J. M.\n* Chen, Y.\n* McMurry, T.\n* Chen, R.\n* Gode, T.\n* Victor, T.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis paper examines the safety performance of the Waymo Driver, an SAE level 4 automated driving system (ADS) used in a rider-only (RO) ride-hailing application without a human driver, either in the vehicle or remotely. ADS crash data was derived from NHTSA’s Standing General Order (SGO) reporting over 7.14 million RO miles through the end of October 2023 in Phoenix, AZ, San Francisco, CA, and Los Angeles, CA. When considering all locations together, the any-injury-reported crashed vehicle rate was 0.41 incidents per million miles (IPMM) for the ADS vs 2.80 IPMM for the human benchmark, an 85% reduction or a human crash rate that is 6.7 times higher than the ADS rate. Police-reported crashed vehicle rates for all locations together were 2.1 IPMM for the ADS vs. 4.68 IPMM for the human benchmark, a 55% reduction or a human crash rate that was 2.2 times higher than the ADS rate. Police-reported and any-injury-reported crashed vehicle rate reductions for the ADS were statistically significant when compared in San Francisco and Phoenix, as well as combined across all locations. The any property damage or injury comparison had statistically significant decrease in 3 comparisons, but also non-significant results in 3 other benchmarks. Given imprecision in the benchmark estimate and multiple potential sources of underreporting biasing the benchmarks, caution should be taken when interpreting the results of the any property damage or injury comparison. Together, these crash-rate results should be interpreted as a directional and continuous confidence growth indicator, together with other methodologies, in a safety case approach.\n",

It leverages best practices in safety impact analysis, invites researchers to replicate the results, and will be regularly updated. This road safety hub provides an unprecedented level of transparency within the autonomous driving industry.\n\n#### **Waymo’s Positive Impact on Road Safety**\n\nTransparency and accountability are essential to achieving our mission to be the world’s most trusted driver. As we continue to scale our operations incrementally and deliberately across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, the Waymo Driver’s positive impact on road safety becomes increasingly evident. To empower communities with a deeper understanding of our safety record, the new data hub shows how the Waymo Driver’s crash rates compare to humans’.\n\nThe analysis builds on the robust methodology that Waymo first [introduced](../../../../blog/2023/12/waymo-significantly-outperforms-comparable-human-benchmarks-over-7-million/) in 2023 and has consistently used to benchmark its safety record. Peer-reviewed\\* by industry experts, the methodology advances the state of the art of crash rate analysis and enables valid comparisons of autonomous and human driving performance. It adheres to the industry best practices, including the recently introduced [RAVE (Retrospective Automated Vehicle Evaluation) checklist](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/researchers-collaborate-on-best-practices-for-automation-research) for safety evaluation that was jointly developed among industry, academic, and insurance collaborators.\n\nThe most recent data shows that over 22 million rider-only miles driven through the end of June, the Waymo Driver has been involved in 84% fewer crashes with airbag deployment, 73% fewer injury-causing crashes, and 48% fewer police-reported crashes compared to human drivers\\*\\*. Notably, this is the first time the airbag deployment metric has been introduced in our crash rate analysis, providing valuable context regarding the severity of crashes with other vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, we provide local metrics for San Francisco and Phoenix, cities where we have driven millions of rider-only miles over time. This allows for statistically significant comparisons with local human benchmarks and demonstrates how the Waymo Driver is improving road safety in each of these cities.\n\nTo ensure the transparency and validity of our findings, we’ve made it easy for others to [reproduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) the results. By leveraging publicly available data — specifically, Waymo’s crash reports submitted under [NHTSA’s Standing General Order (SGO)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting) — and disclosing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data we enable road safety researchers to replicate, and therefore verify, our analysis.\n\nAs we log more miles, we will regularly update the webpage as NHTSA SGO reports are being released.\n\n#### **How the Waymo Driver Reduces Crash Rates**\n\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to the Waymo Driver’s strong safety record. Because the Waymo Driver is programmed to respect the rules of the road like stop signs and speed limits, and because it never drives drunk, drowsy or distracted, the Waymo Driver prevents many common types of crashes from occurring at all. And thanks to its advanced detection and collision avoidance capabilities, it is continuously looking to respond quickly to potential hazards — like another car about to run a red light — in real time.\n\nOur comprehensive [safety framework](https://storage.googleapis.com/waymo-uploads/files/documents/safety/Waymo%20Safety%20Case%20Approach.pdf) is a crucial part of how and why the Waymo Driver improves road safety, providing data supported guidance for our deployments.\n\nJust as a single musical instrument can’t capture all the richness and complexity of a symphony, so too a single metric can’t capture all the complexities and nuances of safe driving. Waymo’s safety framework includes multiple methodologies across hardware, behavior, and operations that each provide a different, complementary part of the answer, coming together to create a rich harmony that’s far more informative than its individual components.\n\nBy introducing the new safety data hub, we aim to provide riders, communities, government officials, and researchers with valuable insights into the impact of Waymo’s driving on road safety. We will also continue to share meaningful information about our safety approach and the complementary methodologies and metrics we employ to evaluate the safety of the Waymo Driver, building on [dozens of safety publications\n\n[Content truncated due to length...]\n\n**Content from https://waymo.com/safety/impact/:**\n[Skip to main content](#main)\n\n# Waymo Safety Impact\n\n## Making roads safer\n\nThe trust and safety of the communities where we operate is paramount to us. That’s why we’re voluntarily sharing our safety data.\n\n**The data to date indicates the Waymo Driver is already making roads safer in the places where we currently operate.** Specifically, the data below demonstrates that the Waymo Driver is better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries — both of any severity and specifically serious ones — as well as those that lead to airbag deployments.\n\nThis hub compares the Waymo Driver’s Rider-Only (RO) crash rates to human crash benchmarks for surface streets. It leverages [best practices](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2435620) in safety impact analysis and builds upon dozens of Waymo’s [safety publications](../../safety/research), providing an unprecedented level of transparency within the autonomous driving industry. By sharing our data and methodologies, we also invite you to join us as we push for advancements in measuring safety impact.\n\n*The data displayed on this webpage undergoes consistent updates aligned with [NHTSA’s Standing General Order](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting) (SGO) reporting timelines.*\n\n## How the Waymo Driver compares to humans\n\n### Rider-only (RO) miles driven\n\nThrough June 2025, Waymo has driven 96M rider-only miles without a human driver\n\nThe Waymo Driver has tens of millions miles of real-world driving experience.

That’s why automation has been held up as a potential game changer for safety. But autonomous vehicles might prevent only around a third of all crashes if automated systems drive too much like people, according to a new study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\n“It’s likely that fully self-driving cars will eventually identify hazards better than people, but we found that this alone would not prevent the bulk of crashes,” says Jessica Cicchino, IIHS vice president for research and a coauthor of the study.\n\nConventional thinking has it that self-driving vehicles could one day make crashes a thing of the past. The reality is not that simple. According to a national survey of police-reported crashes, driver error is the final failure in the chain of events leading to more than 9 out of 10 crashes.\n\nBut the Institute’s analysis suggests that only about a third of those crashes were the result of mistakes that automated vehicles would be expected to avoid simply because they have more accurate perception than human drivers and aren’t vulnerable to incapacitation. To avoid the other two-thirds, they would need to be specifically programmed to prioritize safety over speed and convenience.\n\n“Building self-driving cars that drive as well as people do is a big challenge in itself,” says IIHS Research Scientist Alexandra Mueller, lead author of the study. “But they’d actually need to be better than that to deliver on the promises we’ve all heard.”\n\nTo estimate how many crashes might continue to occur if self-driving cars are designed to make the same decisions about risk that humans do, IIHS researchers examined more than 5,000 police-reported crashes from the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey. Collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, this sample is representative of crashes across the U.S. in which at least one vehicle was towed away, and emergency medical services were called to the scene.\n\nThe IIHS team reviewed the case files and separated the driver-related factors that contributed to the crashes into five categories:\n\n* “Sensing and perceiving” errors included things like driver distraction, impeded visibility and failing to recognize hazards before it was too late.\n* “Predicting” errors occurred when drivers misjudged a gap in traffic, incorrectly estimated how fast another vehicle was going or made an incorrect assumption about what another road user was going to do.\n* “Planning and deciding” errors included driving too fast or too slow for the road conditions, driving aggressively or leaving too little following distance from the vehicle ahead.\n* “Execution and performance” errors included inadequate or incorrect evasive maneuvers, overcompensation and other mistakes in controlling the vehicle.\n* “Incapacitation” involved impairment due to alcohol or drug use, medical problems or falling asleep at the wheel.\n\nThe researchers also determined that some crashes were unavoidable, such as those caused by a vehicle failure like a blowout or broken axle.\n\nFor the study, the researchers imagined a future in which all the vehicles on the road are self-driving. They assumed these future vehicles would prevent those crashes that were caused exclusively by perception errors or involved an incapacitated driver. That’s because cameras and sensors of fully autonomous vehicles could be expected to monitor the roadway and identify potential hazards better than a human driver and be incapable of distraction or incapacitation.\n\nCrashes due to only sensing and perceiving errors accounted for 23 percent of the total, and incapacitation accounted for 10 percent. Those crashes might be avoided if all vehicles on the road were self-driving — though it would require sensors that worked perfectly and systems that never malfunctioned. The remaining two-thirds might still occur unless autonomous vehicles are also specifically programmed to avoid other types of predicting, decision-making and performance errors.\n\nConsider the crash of an Uber test vehicle that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March 2018. Its automated driving system initially struggled to correctly identify 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg on the side of the road. But once it did, it still was not able to predict that she would cross in front of the vehicle, and it failed to execute the correct evasive maneuver to avoid striking her when she did so.\n\nPlanning and deciding errors, such as speeding and illegal maneuvers, were contributing factors in about 40 percent of crashes in the study sample. The fact that deliberate decisions made by drivers can lead to crashes indicates that rider preferences might sometimes conflict with the sa\n\n[Content truncated due to length...]\n",

San Francisco’s AV crash counts also appear in NHTSA SGO summaries for California; California DMV maintains collision report files for AV test fleets operating in SF (many reports redacted). These city-specific differences appear in Waymo’s city tables and are consistent with larger human-benchmark crash rates in dense San Francisco street networks [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].

Toronto’s municipal documents show pilot approvals for delivery and shuttle pilots and planning work (city tactical plan, pilot approvals), but there is little evidence of high-exposure rider-only robotaxi VMT comparable to Waymo’s U.S. cities; therefore city-level AV safety comparisons vs humans are not possible with current public data.

Because VMT by lighting condition is not published in SGO reports (and AV operators do not publicly release crash counts stratified by lighting together with VMT by lighting), rates per-million-miles by lighting cannot be computed from public SGO/Waymo data alone — only proportions of reported incidents.

Because exposure by weather condition (VMT in rain/snow vs dry) is not publicly available for most operators, it is not possible to compute weather-specific AV crash rates vs human rates from public SGO data alone — only the distribution of reported incidents.

Waymo reports large percent reductions (e.g., ~80% fewer injury-causing crashes overall) compared with human benchmarks for the same roadway types and locations. These city-level IPMM comparisons are subject to Waymo’s benchmark construction and statistical uncertainty (Waymo notes some comparisons are not statistically significant where exposure is small) [Source: https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [15][16]\\n\\n3) Key findings (narrative, facts-only) with quantified uncertainty and data limitations\\n- Finding 1 — AV crash reports are concentrated on low-speed surface streets and in dry/daylight conditions (counts): Public SGO summary counts show most reported ADS crashes were on roads <=25 mph and on dry pavement; lighting counts show majority daytime. This aligns with how commercial AV services state they operate (surface streets, restricted speeds, selective-weather operations). However, counts alone do not equal rates; without exposure (VMT) stratified by speed band, lighting, and weather we cannot compute per-mile risk by condition for the overall ADS population. Uncertainty: high for per-mile comparisons by lighting and weather due to lack of exposure data.

[17][18]\\n\\n- Finding 2 — Where high-exposure, well-documented deployments exist (Waymo in Phoenix, SF, LA, Austin), operators report lower injury and serious-crash rates vs local human benchmarks: Waymo’s peer-reviewed analysis and safety hub quantify large percent reductions in injury/serious crash measures in Phoenix and San Francisco using SGO crash reports and operator-provided VMT. These comparisons are statistically significant in some city-level comparisons (Waymo reports significance for Phoenix and San Francisco) but are sensitive to benchmark choice and possible benchmark under-reporting bias; Waymo and independent reviewers caution interpreting the results as one piece of a safety case rather than definitive causal proof.

[19][20]\\n\\n- Finding 3 — AV crash reporting system limitations and redactions constrain cross-city, cross-operator synthesis: NHTSA SGO reports are useful but contain redactions, unverified preliminary details, and do not provide full exposure metrics or consistent fields for e.g., lighting-duration VMT, operator-controlled route vs. non-routed miles, or full fault attribution. State and city collision logs (e.g., CA DMV AV collision reports) provide incident files but many are redacted and submitted under varying timelines; this complicates direct aggregation and per-mile rate calculations across operators or cities. Quantified data gap: SGO summary (July 2024) reports 617 incidents counted but notes redactions and possible duplicate reports; exposure (operator VMT by condition) is frequently absent from public filings.

[21][22]\\n\\n- Finding 4 — AV operators limit operations (speed/conditions) and that operational design bias affects observed safety patterns: Waymo and other operators explicitly restrict operations to surface streets, map and operate at conservative speeds, and limit operations in severe weather or low-visibility conditions — these policies both reduce exposure to higher-speed, adverse-weather crashes (producing the observed concentration on low-speed/dry/daytime reports) and complicate any direct comparison with unconstrained human driving. IIHS analysis also notes that many crashes stem from planning and decision errors (e.g., speeding) that AVs would only avoid if programmed to do so; hence AV operational choices (slow, rule-abiding) are a major mechanism behind reduced injury-crash metrics in published operator comparisons. Uncertainty: moderate; policy/operational differences make generalization across operators and cities uncertain.

[23][24]\\n\\n- Finding 5 — City-to-city heterogeneity: Phoenix (ample RO exposure) shows the clearest, statistically supported reductions in injury metrics in Waymo’s analysis; San Francisco shows larger human-benchmark crash rates (particularly for some severe metrics), producing larger percent reductions when compared against Waymo’s observed IPMM — but absolute Waymo IPMMs differ by city. Toronto and many Canadian municipalities do not have comparable RO exposure (no large robotaxi fleets) so city-level AV vs human comparisons are not possible there using public data through 2025 Q3. Uncertainty: low for the descriptive statement of heterogeneity (documented in Waymo and SGO/DMV files); high for cross-city causal claims.

[25][26]\\n\\n4) Short quantified domain examples and the caveats that accompany them\\n- Example: As-of-July-2024 SGO summary counts — posted-speed band: <=25 mph: 404 incidents (≈65% of 617 reported), 30–55 mph: 167 (≈27%), 60–75 mph: 33 (≈5%) [Source: NHTSA SGO summary]. Because operator VMT by posted-speed band is not provided in SGO public reporting we cannot convert those counts to IPMM by speed band without making strong assumptions about exposure. [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [27][28]\\n\\n- Example: Lighting: 59.5% daylight vs 35% dark-but-lighted (SGO counts). Conversion to per-mile risk would require VMT by lighting; Waymo and other operators do not disclose lighting-stratified VMT publicly in SGO filings; therefore percent differences reported here are counts-only and not per-mile comparisons. Uncertainty: high for any causal claims about night vs day per-mile risk.

[29][30]\\n\\n5) Data quality & gaps (quantified where possible)\\n- Redactions & missing fields: SGO reports and many state/city AV collision PDFs are redacted for confidentiality; this removes key contextual details (fault, distraction, precise timestamps), limiting ability to code cause categories reliably. (SGO summary explicitly notes redactions and preliminary/unverified data.) [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]. [31][32]\\n\\n- Missing exposure stratification: Operator VMT is sometimes disclosed in aggregate (Waymo’s RO miles by city), but exposure broken out by time-of-day, weather, or posted-speed band is not publicly available across operators; this prevents robust per-condition rate estimates. Quantified gap: SGO summary had 617 incidents in July 2024 snapshot but did not provide matched exposure (VMT) per condition; Waymo discloses 96M RO miles through June 2025 but not lighting/weather-split VMT in the public hub. [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [33][34]\\n\\n- Cross-operator generalizability: The strongest per-mile claims are possible only for operators that disclose both crash reports and VMT by city (Waymo provides the most complete public city-level RO VMT and SGO-based crash lists). Other operators (Cruise, Zoox, Nuro, etc.) publish less complete VMT or have more redaction, limiting pooled analyses. Quantified implication: AV safety patterns in public analyses are dominated by Waymo exposure because Waymo discloses tens of millions of RO miles — hence results may reflect Waymo operational design choices as much as intrinsic ADS capabilities. [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]. [35][36]\\n\\n6) Short conclusion (neutral, facts-only)\\n- Public SGO and state/city AV reports through 2025 Q3 indicate that reported ADS crashes are concentrated on low-speed surface streets, in dry conditions, and during daytime (counts). Where an operator provides both crash counts and exposure (Waymo), per‑million‑mile comparisons to carefully constructed local human benchmarks show fewer injury and serious crashes for Waymo’s rider-only operations in cities with substantial exposure (notably Phoenix and San Francisco). However, limitations in public exposure detail (VMT by lighting/weather/speed band), redactions in incident files, and operator operational constraints (avoiding high-speed or severe-weather operations) create substantial uncertainty for condition-specific per‑mile risk comparisons. The strongest, most reliable city-level comparisons are currently limited to operators and cities where both VMT and crash data are publicly disclosed (principally Waymo in Phoenix/SF/LA/Austin) [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/; https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/self-driving-vehicles-could-struggle-to-eliminate-most-crashes].

These Waymo city-level results are drawn from SGO-submitted crash reports and Waymo’s disclosed VMT and benchmark methodology [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/]. [1][2]\\n\\n- San Francisco (CA): Waymo’s analyses show lower crash rates vs local human benchmarks but higher any-injury IPMM and higher airbag-deployment IPMM in San Francisco than Phoenix (Waymo reports San Francisco any-injury IPMM 0.90 vs benchmark 7.93). San Francisco’s AV crash counts also appear in NHTSA SGO summaries for California; California DMV maintains collision report files for AV test fleets operating in SF (many reports redacted). These city-specific differences appear in Waymo’s city tables and are consistent with larger human-benchmark crash rates in dense San Francisco street networks [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].

Austin’s exposure is small (Waymo notes limited mileage in Austin makes some comparisons not statistically significant). NHTSA SGO national summaries show California (including LA) has many of the reported ADS incidents but redaction and reporting differences complicate cross-city fault attribution [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf].

Toronto’s municipal documents show pilot approvals for delivery and shuttle pilots and planning work (city tactical plan, pilot approvals), but there is little evidence of high-exposure rider-only robotaxi VMT comparable to Waymo’s U.S. cities; therefore city-level AV safety comparisons vs humans are not possible with current public data. Toronto pilot documentation and municipal records provide planning detail but not large-scale crash-rate benchmarks or VMT for AVs in Toronto through 2025 Q3 [Source: https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2025/ie/bgrd/backgroundfile-254933.pdf, https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/7ec4-TS_AV-Tactical-Plan_Technical-Report.pdf].

However, limitations in public exposure detail (VMT by lighting/weather/speed band), redactions in incident files, and operator operational constraints (avoiding high-speed or severe-weather operations) create substantial uncertainty for condition-specific per‑mile risk comparisons.

These Waymo city-level results are drawn from SGO-submitted crash reports and Waymo’s disclosed VMT and benchmark methodology [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/]. [1][2]\n\n- San Francisco (CA): Waymo’s analyses show lower crash rates vs local human benchmarks but higher any-injury IPMM and higher airbag-deployment IPMM in San Francisco than Phoenix (Waymo reports San Francisco any-injury IPMM 0.90 vs benchmark 7.93). San Francisco’s AV crash counts also appear in NHTSA SGO summaries for California; California DMV maintains collision report files for AV test fleets operating in SF (many reports redacted). These city-specific differences appear in Waymo’s city tables and are consistent with larger human-benchmark crash rates in dense San Francisco street networks [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]. [3][4]\n\n- Los Angeles (CA) and Austin (TX): Waymo discloses LA and Austin RO mileage and reports crash-rate comparisons; LA shows low IPMM in some metrics (LA serious-crash IPMM 0.00 in Waymo table) but sample sizes differ. Austin’s exposure is small (Waymo notes limited mileage in Austin makes some comparisons not statistically significant). NHTSA SGO national summaries show California (including LA) has many of the reported ADS incidents but redaction and reporting differences complicate cross-city fault attribution [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/, https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf]. [5][6]\n\n- Toronto (ON, Canada): Public AV operations in Toronto are limited compared with the U.S. robotaxi deployments. Toronto’s municipal documents show pilot approvals for delivery and shuttle pilots and planning work (city tactical plan, pilot approvals), but there is little evidence of high-exposure rider-only robotaxi VMT comparable to Waymo’s U.S. cities; therefore city-level AV safety comparisons vs humans are not possible with current public data. Toronto pilot documentation and municipal records provide planning detail but not large-scale crash-rate benchmarks or VMT for AVs in Toronto through 2025 Q3 [Source: https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2025/ie/bgrd/backgroundfile-254933.pdf, https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/7ec4-TS_AV-Tactical-Plan_Technical-Report.pdf]. [7][8]\n\n2) Operating-domain breakdowns (day/night, weather, posted speed bands)\n- Speed (posted limit) distribution of reported AV crashes: NHTSA SGO summary (LSD Data analysis) shows the majority of reported ADS crashes occurred on roads with posted speed limits <=25 mph (404 incidents) vs 167 incidents on 30–55 mph roads and 33 on 60–75 mph roads (counts as reported to NHTSA, July 2024 summary). This indicates AV-reported crashes are concentrated on low-speed surface streets where many ADS services operate [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf]. [9][10]\n\n- Day vs Night: NHTSA SGO summary shows 59.5% (367/617) of reported ADS crashes were in daylight, 35.0% (216/617) in dark-but-lighted conditions, 3.4% at dawn/dusk, and 1.3% in dark-not-lighted (counts as of July 2024). Because VMT by lighting condition is not published in SGO reports (and AV operators do not publicly release crash counts stratified by lighting together with VMT by lighting), rates per-million-miles by lighting cannot be computed from public SGO/Waymo data alone — only proportions of reported incidents. Thus, while a majority of reported ADS crashes happened in daylight (absolute counts), we cannot conclude whether AV crash risk per-mile is higher or lower at night without lighting-stratified exposure (VMT) data [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [11][12]\n\n- Weather / road surface: In NHTSA SGO summary counts, 92.9% of reported ADS crashes occurred on dry roads, 6.3% on wet roads, and 0.2% in snow/slush/ice (July 2024 summary). These proportions largely reflect AV operational domains and seasonality (operators avoid severe-weather operations in many deployments). Because exposure by weather condition (VMT in rain/snow vs dry) is not publicly available for most operators, it is not possible to compute weather-specific AV crash rates vs human rates from public SGO data alone — only the distribution of reported incidents. Waymo and other operators state they limit or modify operations in adverse weather, consistent with the low share of snow-related reports in the SGO summary [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/blog/2024/09/safety-data-hub/]. [13][14]\n\n- Injury / serious-crash metrics by city (Waymo RO private-vehicle comparisons): Waymo’s research and safety hub provide incidents-per-million-miles (IPMM) by city and benchmark comparisons: example figures (Waymo – RO through Oct/June datasets): Phoenix any-injury IPMM 0.63 vs human benchmark 2.06; San Francisco any-injury IPMM 0.90 vs human benchmark 7.93; All-locations any-injury IPMM 0.80 vs benchmark 3.96. Waymo reports large percent reductions (e.g., ~80% fewer injury-causing crashes overall) compared with human benchmarks for the same roadway types and locations. These city-level IPMM comparisons are subject to Waymo’s benchmark construction and statistical uncertainty (Waymo notes some comparisons are not statistically significant where exposure is small) [Source: https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [15][16]\n\n3) Key findings (narrative, facts-only) with quantified uncertainty and data limitations\n- Finding 1 — AV crash reports are concentrated on low-speed surface streets and in dry/daylight conditions (counts): Public SGO summary counts show most reported ADS crashes were on roads <=25 mph and on dry pavement; lighting counts show majority daytime. This aligns with how commercial AV services state they operate (surface streets, restricted speeds, selective-weather operations). However, counts alone do not equal rates; without exposure (VMT) stratified by speed band, lighting, and weather we cannot compute per-mile risk by condition for the overall ADS population. Uncertainty: high for per-mile comparisons by lighting and weather due to lack of exposure data. [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]. [17][18]\n\n- Finding 2 — Where high-exposure, well-documented deployments exist (Waymo in Phoenix, SF, LA, Austin), operators report lower injury and serious-crash rates vs local human benchmarks: Waymo’s peer-reviewed analysis and safety hub quantify large percent reductions in injury/serious crash measures in Phoenix and San Francisco using SGO crash reports and operator-provided VMT. These comparisons are statistically significant in some city-level comparisons (Waymo reports significance for Phoenix and San Francisco) but are sensitive to benchmark choice and possible benchmark under-reporting bias; Waymo and independent reviewers caution interpreting the results as one piece of a safety case rather than definitive causal proof. Uncertainty: moderate — lower for absolute IPMM in Waymo data (they disclose VMT), higher for cross-operator generalization and for establishing causality vs selection/route differences. [Source: https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/; https://waymo.com/blog/2024/09/safety-data-hub/; https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/self-driving-vehicles-could-struggle-to-eliminate-most-crashes]. [19][20]\n\n- Finding 3 — AV crash reporting system limitations and redactions constrain cross-city, cross-operator synthesis: NHTSA SGO reports are useful but contain redactions, unverified preliminary details, and do not provide full exposure metrics or consistent fields for e.g., lighting-duration VMT, operator-controlled route vs. non-routed miles, or full fault attribution. State and city collision logs (e.g., CA DMV AV collision reports) provide incident files but many are redacted and submitted under varying timelines; this complicates direct aggregation and per-mile rate calculations across operators or cities. Quantified data gap: SGO summary (July 2024) reports 617 incidents counted but notes redactions and possible duplicate reports; exposure (operator VMT by condition) is frequently absent from public filings. [Source: https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Committees/Interim/2023-2024/Transportation/Meetings/241007-July-10-2024/03.020-nhtsa-av-crash-data-summary-2024-posting2.pdf; https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]. [21][22]\n\n- Finding 4 — AV operators limit operations (speed/conditions) and that operational design bias affects observed safety patterns: Waymo and other operators explicitly restrict operations to surface streets, map and operate at conservative speeds, and limit operations in severe weather or low-visibility conditions — these policies both reduce exposure to higher-speed, adverse-weather crashes (producing the observed concentration on low-speed/dry/daytime reports) and complicate any direct comparison with unconstrained human driving. IIHS analysis also notes that many crashes stem from planning and decision errors (e.g., speeding) that AVs would only avoid if programmed to do so; hence AV operational choices (slow, rule-abiding) are a major mechanism behind reduced injury-crash metrics in published operator comparisons. Uncertainty: moderate; policy/operational differences make generalization across operators and cities uncertain.

[23][24]\n\n- Finding 5 — City-to-city heterogeneity: Phoenix (ample RO exposure) shows the clearest, statistically supported reductions in injury metrics in Waymo’s analysis; San Francisco shows larger human-benchmark crash rates (particularly for some severe metrics), producing larger percent reductions when compared against Waymo’s observed IPMM — but absolute Waymo IPMMs differ by city. Toronto and many Canadian municipalities do not have comparable RO exposure (no large robotaxi fleets) so city-level AV vs human comparisons are not possible there using public data through 2025 Q3. Uncertainty: low for the descriptive statement of heterogeneity (documented in Waymo and SGO/DMV files); high for cross-city causal claims.
