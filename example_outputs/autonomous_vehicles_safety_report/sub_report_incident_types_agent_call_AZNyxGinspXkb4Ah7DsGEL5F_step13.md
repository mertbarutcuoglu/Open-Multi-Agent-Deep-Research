Sub-report: Primary AV incident categories and contributing factors — Urban North America, 2018–2025 Q3

Observations

Key source URLs used: NHTSA ADS CSV (https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv) [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv]; CA DMV collision reports index (https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/) [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]; Waymo safety hub (https://waymo.com/safety/impact/) [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]; Kusano et al., Traffic Injury Prevention (2024) (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2380786) [Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2380786]; Nature Communications matched case-control (2024) (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4) [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4]; Latent class analysis (Journal of Safety Research, 2025) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634) [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634]; Cruise consent order (NHTSA PDF) (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf) [Source: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf]; DOJ press release re: Cruise DPA (https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/cruise-admits-submitting-false-report-influence-federal-investigation-and-agrees-pay) [Source: https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/cruise-admits-submitting-false-report-influence-federal-investigation-and-agrees-pay].

Decisions
- Research subagent - 2025-11-10T04:32:00Z: Taxonomy & framing — I mapped reported events into a pragmatic incident taxonomy used in the literature and regulatory narratives for urban ADS operations: (A) being rear‑ended while stopped or slowing (AV as stationary victim), (B) AV rear‑ending or striking another vehicle while moving (AV-initiated contact), (C) intersection/turning conflicts (including cutting/turning and red‑light/stop sign interactions), (D) vulnerable road user (VRU) incidents — pedestrian/cyclist strikes or detection failures and near‑misses, (E) sideswipe/merging/ lane‑change conflicts, (F) fixed/object strikes or roadway boundary contacts, and (G) disengagement or operator‑control transitions that precede collisions. I validated the taxonomy against cluster analyses and case studies in the literature and against SGO/OL‑316 narratives [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].

Findings — Top incident categories (ranked qualitatively by prevalence in the sources above and with example references)
Note: available public datasets are heterogenous and partially redacted; exact national counts by category require full structured parsing of NHTSA/DMV CSVs/PDFs. Below I report conservative, source‑anchored summaries and selected examples.

1) Rear‑ended while stopped (AV stationary, hit by another road user)
- Evidence & prevalence: Frequent in CA DMV narratives and appears repeatedly in SGO ADS CSV 'Narrative' examples (multiple monthly entries describing AV stopped and struck from behind) [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].
- Example: Waymo report (Aug 2025) describes an AV stopped in a right‑turn lane that was struck in the rear by an SUV while Waymo ADS was engaged [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].

2) AV rear‑ending another vehicle (AV contact while proceeding/starting from stopped)
- Evidence & prevalence: Identified as a common cluster in CA report analyses (cluster labelled ‘rear‑end collisions after the speed change of AV’ in latent‑class analysis) and present in SGO narratives [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].
- Mechanisms: Often associated with AV speed control (initial acceleration/slow follow), sensor/perception ambiguities in dense stop‑and‑go traffic, or conservative gap acceptance leading to late acceleration responses [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634].

3) Intersection / turning conflicts (including cut‑ins, failed yields and turn‑related collisions)
- Evidence & prevalence: Nature Communications matched‑case study and other papers identify turns and intersection maneuvers as a relatively higher‑risk context for ADS vs human drivers; the Nature study reports AV accidents were more likely under turning conditions (odds ratio ≈ 1.98) and at dawn/dusk (odds ratio ≈ 5.25) relative to matched human‑driver cases [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4]. CA DMV narratives also frequently record collisions during turning or at intersections [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].

4) Vulnerable road user (VRU) incidents — pedestrian/cyclist detection failures, run‑overs, dragging events, and near‑misses
- Evidence & prevalence: High regulatory and investigative attention — Cruise’s Oct 2023 pedestrian run‑over and dragging incident (subject of NHTSA inquiry, consent order, and DOJ deferred‑prosecution action) is a high‑profile example of detection/response failure and reporting problems [Source: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf] [Source: https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/cruise-admits-submitting-false-report-influence-federal-investigation-and-agrees-pay]. CA DMV reports and SGO CSV entries include pedestrian/cyclist‑involved incidents and near‑miss narratives [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].
- Example quantification (company/claims level): Waymo + Swiss Re analysis across 25.3M autonomous miles found very low counts of liability claims (9 property‑damage claims, 2 bodily‑injury claims) and large reductions vs human baselines — used as a company‑level safety benchmark but not a taxonomy of crash types [Source: https://waymo.com/blog/2024/12/new-swiss-re-study-waymo] [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/].

5) Sideswipe / merging / lane‑change conflicts
- Evidence & prevalence: Appears in CA DMV clusters and SGO narratives (including parking/low‑speed sideswipe clusters in LCA) [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].

6) Fixed‑object / curb / boundary contacts
- Evidence: Reported repeatedly in CA narratives and SGO CSV (AV contacting poles/curbs/guardrails or road furniture in urban environments) — often lower severity but indicative of localization/path‑planning edge cases [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].

7) Disengagement / operator transition preceded collisions
- Evidence: Several SGO/OL‑316 narratives describe operator intervention, braking or steering by a human during or immediately after the event; regulatory documents emphasize that some collisions occur during or immediately after an operator takes control or when the ADS was transitioning [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].

Contributing factors — breakdown with quantification where available
- Lighting/time-of-day (dawn/dusk): Nature Communications found a marked increase in AV accident likelihood at dawn/dusk (≈5.25× higher odds compared to matched human cases) [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4].
- Turning maneuvers: Nature reported turning conditions had ≈1.98× higher odds for AV accidents than human drivers in matched comparisons [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4].
- Speed change / stop‑and‑go acceleration profiles: The latent‑class analysis of CA DMV crash narratives identified a dominant cluster characterized as ‘rear‑end after AV speed change,’ linking AV speed-control behavior to a substantial share of collisions in that sample (clustering over a 308‑case CA dataset) [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634].
- External actors’ failure to yield / human driver fault (AV as victim): CA DMV and SGO narratives repeatedly show other drivers failing to yield or driving into the AV’s path — a commonly reported causal text string in narratives [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].
- Perception/detection limits for VRUs: High‑profile Cruise case and other narratives point to sensor/perception misses or classification failures as critical factors in VRU incidents; regulatory documents and the DOJ press release detail concrete failures to detect and to report accurately [Source: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf] [Source: https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/cruise-admits-submitting-false-report-influence-federal-investigation-and-agrees-pay].
- Reporting quality, redactions, & data heterogeneity: CA DMV reports are often redacted for PII; SGO reports are voluntary in structure (narratives vary) and NHTSA has noted caveats in available SGO reporting (unverified initial reports, redactions) — these limit precise national quantification without programmatic parsing and harmonization [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].

Comparison to human drivers (where available)
- Aggregated safety impact (miles‑normalized): Waymo’s peer‑reviewed RO analysis (Kusano et al.) and the Waymo safety hub show ADS (Waymo Driver) crash rates per million miles substantially lower than human benchmarks for serious injuries, airbag deployments, and any‑injury crashes (e.g., Waymo RO any‑injury IPMM 0.80 vs human benchmark 3.96 in combined locations reported on Waymo hub; Kusano et al. report ~0.6 IPMM ADS any‑injury vs 2.80 IPMM human benchmark for their 7.14M‑mile sample) — these comparisons are mile‑normalized and not a direct decomposition by crash category, but they provide evidence that ADS operations to date have lower per‑mile injury crash rates in Waymo’s operating cities [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/] [Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2380786].
- Case‑matched differences by scenario: Nature Communications matched case‑control shows that, overall, ADS‑equipped vehicles have lower accident odds in many scenarios but higher odds in specific contexts (dawn/dusk and turning) — indicating scenario‑dependent relative risk vs human drivers [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4].
- Company‑level claims analysis (insurance proxy): Waymo + Swiss Re analysis over 25.3M miles reported large reductions in property‑damage and bodily‑injury claim frequencies vs human baselines (88% PD reduction; 92% BI reduction), but this is an insurance‑claims proxy and does not specify a breakdown by crash type [Source: https://waymo.com/blog/2024/12/new-swiss-re-study-waymo] [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/].

Data gaps, limitations, and quantification caveats
- Heterogeneous reporting and redactions: CA DMV PDFs are often redacted; SGO CSV narratives are variable and may contain PII redactions and “unknown” flags — both limit automated classification without careful preprocessing [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].
- Company sample bias: Waymo analyses reflect their operating cities and fleet ODDs and should not be generalized nationwide without adjustment; similarly, Cruise regulatory materials highlight under‑reporting and reporting‑quality problems that reduce confidence in aggregated counts absent independent verification [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/] [Source: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf].
- Lack of harmonized, category‑level national counts: Peer‑reviewed analyses use compiled datasets (e.g., Nature used 2,100 AV records) and local DMV files; however, there is not yet a single authoritative, fully harmonized national AV crash ontology covering 2018–2025Q3 that reports category percentages — producing exact percentage splits requires programmatic parsing of SGO CSV and CA OL‑316 PDFs and mapping of narrative text to a standard taxonomy (this parsing remains to be completed) [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].

Conclusions (condensed)
- The dominant incident types in urban ADS operations 2018–2025Q3 (by frequency in public narratives and cluster analyses) are: (1) being rear‑ended while stopped, (2) AV‑rear‑end collisions associated with AV speed changes, (3) intersection/turn‑related conflicts, (4) VRU‑related incidents (pedestrians/cyclists — including high‑profile detection failures), (5) sideswipe/merging conflicts, (6) fixed‑object/curb strikes, and (7) collisions occurring during or immediately after human disengagement/transition. Each category is supported by at least two source types in the public record (SGO CSV entries and CA DMV PDFs plus peer‑reviewed cluster/matched‑case analyses and company/regulatory disclosures) [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4].

Follow‑ups (for the lead researcher — I executed data collection and this is the sub‑report to integrate)
- Research subagent - 2025-11-10T04:32:00Z: Deliverable status — Subtask complete: I assembled taxonomy, sourced supporting evidence, and quantified scenario‑level risk where peer‑reviewed studies provided numbers (dawn/dusk odds, turning odds, miles‑normalized IPMM benchmarks). Key remaining technical task for final lead analysis: programmatic parsing & classification of the full SGO ADS CSV plus batch extraction of CA DMV OL‑316 PDF narratives to produce precise frequency counts and percentage breakdowns for 2018–2025Q3 (this requires OCR/PII‑aware parsing and mapping to the taxonomy). Primary data files to parse: SGO ADS CSV (https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv) and CA DMV OL‑316 PDF set (index at https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/) [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].
