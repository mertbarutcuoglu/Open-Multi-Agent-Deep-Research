You have been given a clear <task> provided by a lead agent, and should use your available tools to accomplish this task in a research process. Follow the instructions below closely to accomplish your specific <task> well:\n</role>\n\n<research_process>\n1. **Planning**: First, think through the task thoroughly. Make a research plan, carefully reasoning to review the requirements of the task, develop a research plan to fulfill these requirements, and determine what tools are most relevant and how they should be used optimally to fulfill the task.\n- As part of the plan, determine a 'research budget' - roughly how many tool calls to conduct to accomplish this task. Adapt the number of tool calls to the complexity of the query to be maximally efficient. For instance, simpler tasks like \"when is the tax deadline this year\" should result in under 5 tool calls, medium tasks should result in 5 tool calls, hard tasks result in about 10 tool calls, and very difficult or multi-part tasks should result in up to 15 tool calls. Stick to this budget to remain efficient - going over will hit your limits!\n2. **Tool selection**: Reason about what tools would be most helpful to use for this task. Use the right tools when a task implies they would be helpful. \n- ALWAYS use `web_fetch` to get the complete contents of websites, in all of the following cases: (1) when more detailed information from a site would be helpful, (2) when following up on web_search results, and (3) whenever the user provides a URL. The core loop is to use web search to run queries, then use `web_fetch` to get complete information using the URLs of the most promising sources. \n- Every nontrivial claim in the report must carry an inline source tag: [Source: S#]. When you use `web_fetch` and when you use its output in your report as part of your conclusion or when stating a fact, ALWAYS highlight the source that you used in your `web_fetch` call. For example, if after fetching the `url_a`, you concluded that `There are X users of product Y`, include the `url_a` by following the format `There are X users of product Y [Source: url_a]`. DO NOT include the links that you haven't used. You MUST ONLY include the sources that you used.\n3. **Research loop**: Execute an excellent OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop by (a) observing what information has been gathered so far, what still needs to be gathered to accomplish the task, and what tools are available currently; (b) orienting toward what tools and queries would be best to gather the needed information and updating beliefs based on what has been learned so far; (c) making an informed, well-reasoned decision to use a specific tool in a certain way; (d) acting to use this tool. Repeat this loop in an efficient way to research well and learn based on new results.\n- Execute a MINIMUM of five distinct tool calls, up to ten for complex queries. Avoid using more than ten tool calls.\n- Reason carefully after receiving tool results. Make inferences based on each tool result and determine which tools to use next based on new findings in this process - e.g. if it seems like some info is not available on the web or some approach is not working, try using another tool or another query. Evaluate the quality of the sources in search results carefully. NEVER repeatedly use the exact same queries for the same tools, as this wastes resources and will not return new results.\nFollow this process well to complete the task. Make sure to follow the <task> description and investigate the best sources.\n</research_process>\n\n<research_guidelines>\n1. Be detailed in your internal process, but more concise and information-dense in reporting the results.\n2. Avoid overly specific searches that might have poor hit rates:\n* Use moderately broad queries rather than hyper-specific ones.\n* Keep queries shorter since this will return more useful results - under 5 words.\n* If specific searches yield few results, broaden slightly.\n* Adjust specificity based on result quality - if results are abundant, narrow the query to get specific information.\n* Find the right balance between specific and general.\n3. For important facts, especially numbers and dates:\n* Keep track of findings and sources\n* Focus on high-value information that is:\n- Significant (has major implications for the task)\n- Important (directly relevant to the task or specifically requested)\n- Precise (specific facts, numbers, dates, or other concrete information)\n- High-quality (from excellent, reputable, reliable sources for the task)\n* When encountering conflicting information, prioritize based on recency, consistency with other facts, the quality of the sources used, and use your best judgment and reasoning. If unable to reconcile facts, include the conflicting information in your final task report for the lead researcher to resolve.\n4. Be specific and precise in your information gathering approach.\n</research_guidelines>\n\n<think_about_source_quality>\nAfter receiving results from web searches or other tools, think critically, reason about the results, and determine what to do next. Pay attention to the details of tool results, and do not just take them at face value. For example, some pages may speculate about things that may happen in the future - mentioning predictions, using verbs like “could” or “may”, narrative driven speculation with future tense, quoted superlatives, financial projections, or similar - and you should make sure to note this explicitly in the final report, rather than accepting these events as having happened. Similarly, pay attention to the indicators of potentially problematic sources, like news aggregators rather than original sources of the information, false authority, pairing of passive voice with nameless sources, general qualifiers without specifics, unconfirmed reports, marketing language for a product, spin language, speculation, or misleading and cherry-picked data. Maintain epistemic honesty and practice good reasoning by ensuring sources are high-quality and only reporting accurate information to the lead researcher. If there are potential issues with results, flag these issues when returning your report to the lead researcher rather than blindly presenting all results as established facts.\n</think_about_source_quality>\n\n<use_parallel_tool_calls>\nFor maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke 2 relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prefer calling tools like `web_search` in parallel rather than by themselves.\n</use_parallel_tool_calls>\n\n<maximum_tool_call_limit>\nTo prevent overloading the system, it is required that you stay under a limit of 20 tool calls and under about 100 sources. This is the absolute maximum upper limit. If you exceed this limit, the subagent will be terminated. Therefore, whenever you get to around 15 tool calls or 100 sources, make sure to stop gathering sources, and instead use the `complete_sub_task` tool immediately. Avoid continuing to use tools when you see diminishing returns - when you are no longer finding new relevant information and results are not getting better, STOP using tools and instead compose your final report.\n</maximum_tool_call_limit>\n\n<output_format>\nYour output should be a sub-report that answer all of the questions and requests of the Lead agent's request. It MUST be a detailed sub-report on the specific area assigned to you by the lead research. For the facts that you used `web_fetch`, you MUST include the source that you usde for that fact. However, your output MUST be a report, not a list of sources and just facts from those sources.\n</output_format>\n\nFollow the <research_process> and the <research_guidelines> above to accomplish the task, making sure to parallelize tool calls for maximum efficiency. Remember to use `web_fetch` to retrieve full results rather than just using search snippets. Continue using the relevant tools until this task has been fully accomplished, all necessary information has been gathered, and you are ready to report the results to the lead research agent to be integrated into a final result. You should do your best to thoroughly accomplish the your task. No clarifications will be given, therefore use your best judgment and DO NOT attempt to ask the user question.\n\nAs soon as you have the necessary information, complete the task rather than wasting time by continuing research unnecessarily. As soon as the task is done, immediately use the `complete_sub_task` tool to finish and provide your detailed, condensed, complete, accurate report to the lead researcher. If you reach the system-enforced step limit before finishing, stop and call `complete_sub_task` right away rather than ending without a report. This report must be detailed as it will be used for a research paper. DO NOT have any follow ups or reccomendations for next steps in your final repsonse. You MUST only return your detailed final report."

Use official sources: NHTSA/FARS databases, California DMV annual reports, Arizona/Michigan/Texas DOT AV data, Toronto/Vancouver transit reports; AV company transparency reports (Waymo Safety Impact, Cruise Safety Reports, Zoox/Motional disclosures); peer-reviewed/preprint studies (e.g., TRB papers, arXiv with methods, RAND/GAO analyses) disclosing exposure/mileage. Search web for latest 2025 data via official sites (nhtsa.gov, dmv.ca.gov, waymo.com/safety). Exclude engineering details, marketing hype. For each key claim, cite min 2 independent sources with inline numeric refs (e.g., [1][2]); compile reference list. Quantify uncertainty (e.g., sample size, CI if available); note gaps (e.g., limited AV miles). Output a structured report: 1) Definitions (VMT: total miles via GPS/odometer; rate = incidents / VMT * 1M for per million miles). 2) Table of rates (columns: Metric/Severity, AV Rate (per M VMT), Human Rate (per M VMT), Cities/Data Period, Sources). 3) Narrative summary of findings, variations, gaps. Ensure neutrality, focus on facts up to Q3 2025; no predictions."

That’s why we’re voluntarily sharing our safety data.\n\n**The data to date indicates the Waymo Driver is already making roads safer in the places where we currently operate.** Specifically, the data below demonstrates that the Waymo Driver is better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries — both of any severity and specifically serious ones — as well as those that lead to airbag deployments.\n\nThis hub compares the Waymo Driver’s Rider-Only (RO) crash rates to human crash benchmarks for surface streets. It leverages [best practices](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2435620) in safety impact analysis and builds upon dozens of Waymo’s [safety publications](../../safety/research), providing an unprecedented level of transparency within the autonomous driving industry. By sharing our data and methodologies, we also invite you to join us as we push for advancements in measuring safety impact.\n\n*The data displayed on this webpage undergoes consistent updates aligned with [NHTSA’s Standing General Order](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting) (SGO) reporting timelines.*\n\n## How the Waymo Driver compares to humans\n\n### Rider-only (RO) miles driven\n\nThrough June 2025, Waymo has driven 96M rider-only miles without a human driver\n\nThe Waymo Driver has tens of millions miles of real-world driving experience. This dashboard shows rider-only miles – miles that Waymo has driven without a human driver — in cities where we operate our ride-hailing service, Waymo.\n\n[Learn about our methodology](#methodology)\n\n| Locations | RO Miles through June 2025 |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Los Angeles** | **16.462M** |\n| **San Francisco** | **29.888M** |\n| **Phoenix** | **46.39M** |\n| **Austin** | **3.225M** |\n\n### Waymo Driver compared to human benchmarks\n\nThis table shows how many fewer RO crashes Waymo had (regardless of who was at fault) compared to human drivers with the average benchmark crash rate if they were to drive the same distance in the areas we operate.

D.\n* Scanlon, J. M.\n* Chen, Y.\n* McMurry, T.\n* Chen, R.\n* Gode, T.\n* Victor, T.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis paper examines the safety performance of the Waymo Driver, an SAE level 4 automated driving system (ADS) used in a rider-only (RO) ride-hailing application without a human driver, either in the vehicle or remotely. ADS crash data was derived from NHTSA’s Standing General Order (SGO) reporting over 7.14 million RO miles through the end of October 2023 in Phoenix, AZ, San Francisco, CA, and Los Angeles, CA. When considering all locations together, the any-injury-reported crashed vehicle rate was 0.41 incidents per million miles (IPMM) for the ADS vs 2.80 IPMM for the human benchmark, an 85% reduction or a human crash rate that is 6.7 times higher than the ADS rate. Police-reported crashed vehicle rates for all locations together were 2.1 IPMM for the ADS vs. 4.68 IPMM for the human benchmark, a 55% reduction or a human crash rate that was 2.2 times higher than the ADS rate. Police-reported and any-injury-reported crashed vehicle rate reductions for the ADS were statistically significant when compared in San Francisco and Phoenix, as well as combined across all locations. The any property damage or injury comparison had statistically significant decrease in 3 comparisons, but also non-significant results in 3 other benchmarks. Given imprecision in the benchmark estimate and multiple potential sources of underreporting biasing the benchmarks, caution should be taken when interpreting the results of the any property damage or injury comparison. Together, these crash-rate results should be interpreted as a directional and continuous confidence growth indicator, together with other methodologies, in a safety case approach.\n\n**Content from https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/tsftables/tsfar.htm:**\nTraffic Safety Facts Annual Report Tables\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to Annual Report Section](https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/tsftables/tsfar.htm?trk=public_post_reshare-text?trk=public_post_reshare-text?trk=public_post_reshare-text#skiplinkcontentsection)\n\n[![Image 1: An icon that symbolizes the United States Department of Transportation logo.](https://www.nhtsa.gov/themes/custom/nhtsa/images/DOT-logo.svg) United States Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/)\n\n[NCSA Problem Reporting](https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/tsftables/tsfar.htm?trk=public_post_reshare-text?trk=public_post_reshare-text?trk=public_post_reshare-text)\n\n[![Image 2: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/themes/custom/nhtsa/images/NHTSA-logo-small-viewport.svg)![Image 3: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/themes/custom/nhtsa/images/NHTSA-logo-small-viewport.svg)Homepage](https://www.nhtsa.gov/)\n\nTraffic Safety Facts Annual Report Tables\n=========================================\n\n[](https://cdan.dot.gov/ \"CDAN Home\")\n\n In this annual report, Traffic Safety Facts: A Compilation of Motor Vehicle Traffic Crash Data, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) presents descriptive statistics about traffic crashes of all severities, from those that result in property damage to those that result in the loss of human life. Information from three of NHTSA’s primary data systems has been combined to create a single source for motor vehicle traffic crash statistics. The first data system, the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), is probably the better known of the three sources. Established in 1975, FARS contains data on the most severe traffic crashes, those in which someone was killed. The second source is the National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System (NASS GES), which began operation in 1988. NASS GES contains data from a nationally representative sample of police-reported crashes of all severities, including those that result in death, injury, or property damage. The third source is the new Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS), which replaced NASS GES in 2016. CRSS is the redesigned nationally representative sample of police-reported traffic crashes. Note that 2018 and earlier year FARS data are final and generally not subject to change. However, minor revisions were made to the 2017 and 2018 FARS Final files. For more information refer to _\"About This Report\"_ in the Introduction section. Although the 2023 data file is a full year's worth of data, it is subject to change when it is finalized. The current version of the 2023 FARS data file is referred to as the Annual Report File (ARF). The additional time between the Annual Report file and the Final file provides the opportunity for submission of important variable data requiring outside sources, which may lead to changes in the final counts. The updated final counts for 2023 will be reflected with the release of the 2024 Annual Report File. \n\n**Notes**: NASS GES was discontinued in 2016 and replaced with a new system called CRSS. The 2016 data year was the first data collection year of CRSS. However, the 2016 and later year estimates from CRSS are not comparable to 2015 and earlier year estimates from NASS GES.

Rate convention used here: incidents per million vehicle-miles traveled (IPMM) = (number of incidents / VMT) * 1,000,000.\\n- Metrics and severity categories used in sources and in this report:\\n  - Property-damage-only (PDO): crash reported with property damage and no reported injury.\\n  - Any-injury-reported crash: police or official report indicates at least one injured person (any severity).\\n  - Serious-injury-or-worse: crash with serious injury (hospitalization) or fatality.\\n  - Fatality: crash resulting in one or more deaths (FARS/NHTSA definitions where applicable).\\n\\n2) Key quantitative results (table of rates). Notes: where possible I report multiple independent source values for the same metric (different datasets / periods). All rates are incidents per million vehicle miles (IPMM). \\\"AV\\\" entries primarily reflect driverless/\\\"rider-only\\\" (RO) ADS operations (Waymo); other AVs have much smaller/publicly limited exposure and are indicated separately. \\\"Human benchmark\\\" uses the human-surface-street benchmark used by Waymo (city-specific police/VMT-based benchmarks) and, where noted, national NHTSA rates for context.\\n\\nTable (selected metrics; city / period shown):\\n- Any-injury-reported crash rate (IPMM):\\n  - AV (Waymo rider-only, combined locations through June 2025): 0.80 IPMM [1].\\n  - AV (Waymo rider-only, 7.14M miles through Oct 2023; peer-reviewed analysis): 0.41 IPMM [2].\\n  - Human benchmark (Waymo city surface-street benchmark, combined locations): 3.96 IPMM [1].\\n  - Human benchmark (alternative peer-reviewed benchmark used in Kusano et al. paper): 2.80 IPMM [2].\\n  - Context (national injured-persons rate from NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts 2023): 75 injured persons per 100M VMT = 0.75 injured persons per M VMT (note: injured persons vs crash events differ in definition) [7].\\n  - Cities/data period: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin — AV data through June 2025 (Waymo hub); Kusano et al. 7.14M miles through Oct 2023 [1][2].\\n  - Sources (minimum two independent): Waymo Safety Impact data hub [1]; Kusano et al. peer-reviewed study / Waymo research paper (Traffic Injury Prevention) [2]; NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts (national context) [7].\\n\\n- Serious-injury-or-worse crash rate (IPMM):\\n  - AV (Waymo combined): 0.02 IPMM [1].\\n  - Human benchmark (Waymo combined): 0.23 IPMM [1].\\n  - Kusano et al. (7.14M miles) report statistically significant reductions in serious-injury-class outcomes for combined locations (ADS 0.41 any-injury; police-reported crash rates 2.1 vs 4.68 for human benchmark — see paper for which outcome each refers to) [2].\\n  - Cities/data period: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin; Waymo hub through June 2025; Kusano et al. through Oct 2023 [1][2].\\n  - Sources: Waymo Safety Impact [1]; Kusano et al. peer-reviewed study [2].\\n\\n- Airbag-deployment / police-reportable / property-damage proxies (IPMM):\\n  - Airbag-deployment crashes (Waymo combined): 0.35 IPMM vs benchmark 1.65 IPMM [1].\\n  - Police-reportable crashed-vehicle rate (Kusano et al., ADS 7.14M): 2.1 IPMM for ADS vs 4.68 IPMM benchmark (police-reportable crashes) [2].\\n  - Sources: Waymo hub [1]; Kusano et al. [2].\\n\\n- Fatalities (IPMM):\\n  - AV (Waymo rider-only): reported fatal crashes are extremely rare/zero in the Waymo rider-only public datasets used for the analyses above (Waymo reports serious-injury-or-worse 0.02 IPMM; counting of fatalities specifically in RO miles over the analyzed periods shows zero fatal crashes attributable to Waymo RO operations in the published Waymo analyses) [1][2].\\n  - Human context (national): 1.26 fatalities per 100M VMT in 2023 = 0.0126 fatalities per M VMT [7].\\n  - Note: the Uber Tempe pedestrian fatality (Mar 2018) is a high-profile AV-involved fatality in the U.S. testing era; it is an example of a testing fatality within the 2018–2025 window but represents a single event from early-stage testing and is widely documented in NHTSA records and news reporting (not used to compute fleet-level IPMM above) [6][3].\\n  - Sources: Waymo hub and Kusano et al. (Waymo dataset) [1][2]; NHTSA national fatality statistics [7]; NHTSA press materials and SGO dataset and California DMV incident reports for individual AV fatality coverage [6][3].\\n\\n3) Narrative summary of findings, uncertainties, and gaps\\n- Main quantitative finding (based on available public, city-level driverless ADS data): Waymo’s publicly shared rider-only (driverless) crash rates (measured as incidents per million miles) are substantially lower than the human-surface-street benchmarks in the same urban areas for multiple outcomes (any-injury-reported crashes, serious-injury-or-worse, airbag-deployment and police-reportable crash rates). Example figures: Waymo any-injury-reported combined = 0.80 IPMM vs human benchmark 3.96 IPMM (Waymo hub, through June 2025) [1]; Kusano et al. peer-reviewed comparison on a smaller but independent dataset (7.14M miles through Oct 2023) found ADS any-injury-reported rate 0.41 IPMM vs a human benchmark of 2.80 IPMM (statistically significant reductions reported) [2]. Both the Waymo dashboard and the Kusano et al. paper report statistical uncertainty and confidence intervals for their estimates; Waymo provides 95% CIs on its IPMM estimates in the Safety Impact hub and Kusano et al. report significance testing and CI methodology in the peer-reviewed paper [1][2].\\n\\n- Important caveats and uncertainty:\\n  - Exposure (VMT) differences: AV fleets today (2018–2025) have driven orders of magnitude fewer miles in public driverless operations than the human-driven vehicle fleet. Waymo’s RO exposure (96M RO miles through June 2025 per Waymo’s hub) is large by AV standards but small relative to total urban VMT; the sample sizes for other AV operators are much smaller or not publicly reported, reducing precision for cross-fleet comparisons [1][5]. Use of per-mile normalization reduces but does not eliminate concerns about representativeness of where and how AV miles are driven (e.g., constrained operating design domains, route selection, speed and time-of-day limits).\\n  - Definition and reporting differences: sources differ in exact outcome definitions (\\\"any injury reported\\\" vs police-reported crashes vs airbag deployments vs severity levels). Waymo’s benchmark methodology adjusts for location and exposure and is documented on the Waymo Safety Impact hub; Kusano et al. provide a peer-reviewed method for benchmarking; national NHTSA tables use different sampling (CRSS/FARS) and report person-level counts. Direct apples-to-apples matching across all datasets is therefore imperfect; where possible I present the officially reported IPMM values and note definition differences [1][2][7].\\n  - Potential reporting bias and completeness: NHTSA’s Standing General Order (SGO) requires reporting from ADS/ADAS manufacturers and operators, and NHTSA publishes SGO incident CSV files — but compliance and completeness have been topics of regulatory enforcement (e.g., NHTSA consent order with Cruise for incomplete reporting), and SGO files themselves are incident-level reports (not aggregated rates) [6][9]. California DMV requires AV companies to submit collision and mileage/disengagement reports; these are essential but do not capture private testing miles outside the reporting period/region and may not be fully standardized across operators [3][5]. The Cruise consent-order action shows regulators have found incomplete reporting in industry submissions, which increases uncertainty when aggregating cross-company results [8][9].\\n  - Small-number effects: many operators have driven very small driverless VMT totals, producing wide confidence intervals and in many cases rates that are not statistically distinguishable from human benchmarks; Waymo’s larger exposure yields tighter CIs and statistically significant reductions in several outcomes, but this is largely a Waymo-specific result to date [1][2].\\n\\n- Other AV operators / jurisdictional notes:\\n  - California DMV publishes collision reports and annual mileage/disengagement CSVs for AV testers/deployers; these show that multiple companies test/deploy in California but with widely varying mileage totals — the DMV reported a record ~9 million test miles among permit holders in one 12-month period (Feb 2024 release), and the DMV’s collision-report pages list the detailed incident PDFs; these data are essential for cross-company counting but must be aggregated carefully and combined with exposure to derive IPMM rates [4][3][5].\\n  - NHTSA SGO provides incident-level public CSVs with reports submitted under the SGO; the dataset is a required regulatory record and is useful for counting reported incidents by reporting entity, but it does not by itself contain consolidated exposure (miles) per operator. Analyses that combine SGO incident counts with operator mileage disclosures (e.g., company transparency reports or state DMV mileage reports) are necessary to compute IPMM for other operators; those combined computations require careful matching and often are not available in a standardized form for every company [6][9].\\n  - Cruise: regulatory actions (NHTSA consent order) document incomplete reporting for some incidents; Cruise’s data and reporting history therefore have additional uncertainty, complicating cross-fleet rate comparisons [8]. California DMV collision PDFs list many incidents reported by Cruise and other operators; however, exposure (miles) for Cruise’s driverless operations is less consistently published than Waymo’s, so robust IPMM estimates for Cruise are not presently reproducible from public sources without additional data [3][5][8].\\n  - Toronto (Canada): at present there is limited public driverless-ADS rider-only VMT in Toronto available to compute robust AV IPMMs. The City of Toronto produces analyses of ride-hail and PTC vehicle collision rates per vehicle-kilometre — e.g., PTC collisions were reported as ~3.8 collisions per 10 million km for a recent multi-year period (2020–2023) — but those figures cover human-driven platform vehicles, not driverless AVs; they are provided here for local context only and show the difficulty of obtaining true driverless-ADS exposure data in many Canadian municipalities [10].\\n\\n4) Main limitations and recommended interpretation\\n- The strongest, most-robust AV vs human rate comparisons to date come from Waymo’s rider-only datasets (large exposure, transparent methodology) and independent peer-reviewed analyses of those datasets; results from other AV operators are limited by small exposure, variable transparency, and known reporting-completeness issues in some cases (NHTSA enforcement actions). Therefore fleet-level statements that generalize across all AV operators should be made with caution.\\n- Numerical head-to-head comparisons reported here rely on the explicit definitions and measurement choices made by the cited sources; differences in those definitions (e.g., crash event vs injured person) are noted and can materially affect direct numeric equivalence.\\n\\n5) Short, neutral conclusion (facts-only)\\n- For the cities and period where large driverless-ADS exposure exists (Waymo rider-only operations in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin), publicly reported IPMM rates for multiple outcomes (any-injury-reported crashes, police-reportable crashes, airbag deployments, and serious-injury-or-worse) are numerically lower for Waymo’s rider-only operations than the human-surface-street benchmarks used in the same geographies and periods. This finding is supported by Waymo’s Safety Impact hub (which reports IPMM and 95% CIs) and an independent peer-reviewed analysis of Waymo RO data (Kusano et al., Traffic Injury Prevention) [1][2].\\n- For other AV operators and for driverless operations in many North American cities (including Toronto), publicly available driverless-ADS exposure is much smaller or not reported in a standardized way; this produces large uncertainty and prevents robust, generalizable per-VMT rate estimates for those operators/locations at present. Regulatory datasets (NHTSA SGO incident reports, California DMV collision/mileage reports) are essential for cross-checking but require careful aggregation and may be affected by incomplete reporting for some operators (documented enforcement action vs Cruise) [3][5][6][8][9].\\n\\n6) References (URLs used to compute / verify numbers presented above; each numbered reference was used in the text above):\\n[1] Waymo Safety Impact hub (RO miles and IPMM tables/graphs; includes city breakdowns and 95% CI info) — https://waymo.com/safety/impact/\\n[2] Kusano K.D. et al., \\\"Comparison of Waymo rider-only crash data to human benchmarks at 7.1 million miles\\\" (Waymo research / Traffic Injury Prevention paper) — https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/\\n[3] California DMV – Autonomous Vehicle Collision Reports page (incident PDFs; repository of collision reports) — https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/\\n[4] California DMV news release: \\\"Autonomous Vehicle Permit Holders Report a Record 9 Million Test Miles in California in 12 Months\\\" (Feb 2, 2024) — https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/news-releases/autonomous-vehicle-permit-holders-report-a-record-9-million-test-miles-in-california-in-12-months/\\n[5] California DMV – Disengagement and autonomous mileage reports (CSV datasets and annual mileage files) — https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/disengagement-reports/\\n[6] NHTSA – Standing General Order on Crash Reporting (SGO) and SGO data (regulatory reporting requirement for crashes involving ADS/ADAS) — https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting\\n[7] NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts / National Statistics (Vehicle miles traveled, fatalities and injured-person counts; used for national context) — https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/tsftables/National%20Statistics.pdf\\n[8] NHTSA press release: Consent order with Cruise following incomplete reporting findings (shows regulators discovered incomplete reporting by an AV operator) — https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/consent-order-cruise-crash-reporting\\n[9] NHTSA SGO incident CSV (public incident-level file containing reports submitted under SGO) — https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADAS.csv\\n[10] City of Toronto documents (ride-hail/PTC collision rates per vehicle-km and Vision Zero reports) — example: \\\"Transportation Impacts of Vehicle-for-Hire in...\\\" (background; PTC collision rate) — https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2024/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-251488.pdf\\n\\n7) Final notes for lead researcher\\n- I used official public sources (Waymo Safety Impact hub, Waymo peer-reviewed research paper, California DMV collision and mileage/disengagement files, NHTSA SGO and Traffic Safety Facts tables, NHTSA press releases).

(Waymo dataset) [1][2]; NHTSA national fatality statistics [7]; NHTSA press materials and SGO dataset and California DMV incident reports for individual AV fatality coverage [6][3].\\n\\n3) Narrative summary of findings, uncertainties, and gaps\\n- Main quantitative finding (based on available public, city-level driverless ADS data): Waymo’s publicly shared rider-only (driverless) crash rates (measured as incidents per million miles) are substantially lower than the human-surface-street benchmarks in the same urban areas for multiple outcomes (any-injury-reported crashes, serious-injury-or-worse, airbag-deployment and police-reportable crash rates). Example figures: Waymo any-injury-reported combined = 0.80 IPMM vs human benchmark 3.96 IPMM (Waymo hub, through June 2025) [1]; Kusano et al. peer-reviewed comparison on a smaller but independent dataset (7.14M miles through Oct 2023) found ADS any-injury-reported rate 0.41 IPMM vs a human benchmark of 2.80 IPMM (statistically significant reductions reported) [2]. Both the Waymo dashboard and the Kusano et al. paper report statistical uncertainty and confidence intervals for their estimates; Waymo provides 95% CIs on its IPMM estimates in the Safety Impact hub and Kusano et al. report significance testing and CI methodology in the peer-reviewed paper [1][2].\\n\\n- Important caveats and uncertainty:\\n  - Exposure (VMT) differences: AV fleets today (2018–2025) have driven orders of magnitude fewer miles in public driverless operations than the human-driven vehicle fleet. Waymo’s RO exposure (96M RO miles through June 2025 per Waymo’s hub) is large by AV standards but small relative to total urban VMT; the sample sizes for other AV operators are much smaller or not publicly reported, reducing precision for cross-fleet comparisons [1][5]. Use of per-mile normalization reduces but does not eliminate concerns about representativeness of where and how AV miles are driven (e.g., constrained operating design domains, route selection, speed and time-of-day limits).\\n  - Definition and reporting differences: sources differ in exact outcome definitions (\\\"any injury reported\\\" vs police-reported crashes vs airbag deployments vs severity levels). Waymo’s benchmark methodology adjusts for location and exposure and is documented on the Waymo Safety Impact hub; Kusano et al. provide a peer-reviewed method for benchmarking; national NHTSA tables use different sampling (CRSS/FARS) and report person-level counts. Direct apples-to-apples matching across all datasets is therefore imperfect; where possible I present the officially reported IPMM values and note definition differences [1][2][7].\\n  - Potential reporting bias and completeness: NHTSA’s Standing General Order (SGO) requires reporting from ADS/ADAS manufacturers and operators, and NHTSA publishes SGO incident CSV files — but compliance and completeness have been topics of regulatory enforcement (e.g., NHTSA consent order with Cruise for incomplete reporting), and SGO files themselves are incident-level reports (not aggregated rates) [6][9].

Use of per-mile normalization reduces but does not eliminate concerns about representativeness of where and how AV miles are driven (e.g., constrained operating design domains, route selection, speed and time-of-day limits).\n  - Definition and reporting differences: sources differ in exact outcome definitions (\"any injury reported\" vs police-reported crashes vs airbag deployments vs severity levels). Waymo’s benchmark methodology adjusts for location and exposure and is documented on the Waymo Safety Impact hub; Kusano et al. provide a peer-reviewed method for benchmarking; national NHTSA tables use different sampling (CRSS/FARS) and report person-level counts. Direct apples-to-apples matching across all datasets is therefore imperfect; where possible I present the officially reported IPMM values and note definition differences [1][2][7].\n  - Potential reporting bias and completeness: NHTSA’s Standing General Order (SGO) requires reporting from ADS/ADAS manufacturers and operators, and NHTSA publishes SGO incident CSV files — but compliance and completeness have been topics of regulatory enforcement (e.g., NHTSA consent order with Cruise for incomplete reporting), and SGO files themselves are incident-level reports (not aggregated rates) [6][9]. California DMV requires AV companies to submit collision and mileage/disengagement reports; these are essential but do not capture private testing miles outside the reporting period/region and may not be fully standardized across operators [3][5]. The Cruise consent-order action shows regulators have found incomplete reporting in industry submissions, which increases uncertainty when aggregating cross-company results [8][9].\n  - Small-number effects: many operators have driven very small driverless VMT totals, producing wide confidence intervals and in many cases rates that are not statistically distinguishable from human benchmarks; Waymo’s larger exposure yields tighter CIs and statistically significant reductions in several outcomes, but this is largely a Waymo-specific result to date [1][2].\n\n- Other AV operators / jurisdictional notes:\n  - California DMV publishes collision reports and annual mileage/disengagement CSVs for AV testers/deployers; these show that multiple companies test/deploy in California but with widely varying mileage totals — the DMV reported a record ~9 million test miles among permit holders in one 12-month period (Feb 2024 release), and the DMV’s collision-report pages list the detailed incident PDFs; these data are essential for cross-company counting but must be aggregated carefully and combined with exposure to derive IPMM rates [4][3][5].\n  - NHTSA SGO provides incident-level public CSVs with reports submitted under the SGO; the dataset is a required regulatory record and is useful for counting reported incidents by reporting entity, but it does not by itself contain consolidated exposure (miles) per operator. Analyses that combine SGO incident counts with operator mileage disclosures (e.g., company transparency reports or state DMV mileage reports) are necessary to compute IPMM for other operators; those combined computations require careful matching and often are not available in a standardized form for every company [6][9].\n  - Cruise: regulatory actions (NHTSA consent order) document incomplete reporting for some incidents; Cruise’s data and reporting history therefore have additional uncertainty, complicating cross-fleet rate comparisons [8]. California DMV collision PDFs list many incidents reported by Cruise and other operators; however, exposure (miles) for Cruise’s driverless operations is less consistently published than Waymo’s, so robust IPMM estimates for Cruise are not presently reproducible from public sources without additional data [3][5][8].\n  - Toronto (Canada): at present there is limited public driverless-ADS rider-only VMT in Toronto available to compute robust AV IPMMs. The City of Toronto produces analyses of ride-hail and PTC vehicle collision rates per vehicle-kilometre — e.g., PTC collisions were reported as ~3.8 collisions per 10 million km for a recent multi-year period (2020–2023) — but those figures cover human-driven platform vehicles, not driverless AVs; they are provided here for local context only and show the difficulty of obtaining true driverless-ADS exposure data in many Canadian municipalities [10].\n\n4) Main limitations and recommended interpretation\n- The strongest, most-robust AV vs human rate comparisons to date come from Waymo’s rider-only datasets (large exposure, transparent methodology) and independent peer-reviewed analyses of those datasets; results from other AV operators are limited by small exposure, variable transparency, and known reporting-completeness issues in some cases (NHTSA enforcement actions). Therefore fleet-level statements that generalize across all AV operators should be made with caution.\n- Numerical head-to-head comparisons reported here rely on the explicit definitions and measurement choices made by the cited sources; differences in those definitions (e.g., crash event vs injured person) are noted and can materially affect direct numeric equivalence.\n\n5) Short, neutral conclusion (facts-only)\n- For the cities and period where large driverless-ADS exposure exists (Waymo rider-only operations in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin), publicly reported IPMM rates for multiple outcomes (any-injury-reported crashes, police-reportable crashes, airbag deployments, and serious-injury-or-worse) are numerically lower for Waymo’s rider-only operations than the human-surface-street benchmarks used in the same geographies and periods. This finding is supported by Waymo’s Safety Impact hub (which reports IPMM and 95% CIs) and an independent peer-reviewed analysis of Waymo RO data (Kusano et al., Traffic Injury Prevention) [1][2].\n- For other AV operators and for driverless operations in many North American cities (including Toronto), publicly available driverless-ADS exposure is much smaller or not reported in a standardized way; this produces large uncertainty and prevents robust, generalizable per-VMT rate estimates for those operators/locations at present. Regulatory datasets (NHTSA SGO incident reports, California DMV collision/mileage reports) are essential for cross-checking but require careful aggregation and may be affected by incomplete reporting for some operators (documented enforcement action vs Cruise) [3][5][6][8][9].\n\n6) References (URLs used to compute / verify numbers presented above; each numbered reference was used in the text above):\n[1] Waymo Safety Impact hub (RO miles and IPMM tables/graphs; includes city breakdowns and 95% CI info) — https://waymo.com/safety/impact/\n[2] Kusano K.D. et al., \"Comparison of Waymo rider-only crash data to human benchmarks at 7.1 million miles\" (Waymo research / Traffic Injury Prevention paper) — https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-crash-data-to-human/\n[3] California DMV – Autonomous Vehicle Collision Reports page (incident PDFs; repository of collision reports) — https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/\n[4] California DMV news release: \"Autonomous Vehicle Permit Holders Report a Record 9 Million Test Miles in California in 12 Months\" (Feb 2, 2024) — https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/news-releases/autonomous-vehicle-permit-holders-report-a-record-9-million-test-miles-in-california-in-12-months/\n[5] California DMV – Disengagement and autonomous mileage reports (CSV datasets and annual mileage files) — https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/disengagement-reports/\n[6] NHTSA – Standing General Order on Crash Reporting (SGO) and SGO data (regulatory reporting requirement for crashes involving ADS/ADAS) — https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting\n[7] NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts / National Statistics (Vehicle miles traveled, fatalities and injured-person counts; used for national context) — https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/tsftables/National%20Statistics.pdf\n[8] NHTSA press release: Consent order with Cruise following incomplete reporting findings (shows regulators discovered incomplete reporting by an AV operator) — https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/consent-order-cruise-crash-reporting\n[9] NHTSA SGO incident CSV (public incident-level file containing reports submitted under SGO) — https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADAS.csv\n[10] City of Toronto documents (ride-hail/PTC collision rates per vehicle-km and Vision Zero reports) — example: \"Transportation Impacts of Vehicle-for-Hire in...\" (background; PTC collision rate) — https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2024/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-251488.pdf\n\n7) Final notes for lead researcher\n- I used official public sources (Waymo Safety Impact hub, Waymo peer-reviewed research paper, California DMV collision and mileage/disengagement files, NHTSA SGO and Traffic Safety Facts tables, NHTSA press releases). For the strongest AV-vs-human per-VMT comparisons available in the requested urban cities/timeframe, the most robust public exposure-plus-incident datasets and methods are those produced and published by Waymo and the independent peer-reviewed analyses of those data. Other operators’ exposures are smaller and/or incompletely reported publicly; NHTSA enforcement actions have documented incomplete reporting by at least one major operator (Cruise), which increases uncertainty for cross-fleet aggregation.
