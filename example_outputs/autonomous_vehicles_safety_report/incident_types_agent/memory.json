That’s why we’re voluntarily sharing our safety data.\n\n**The data to date indicates the Waymo Driver is already making roads safer in the places where we currently operate.** Specifically, the data below demonstrates that the Waymo Driver is better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries — both of any severity and specifically serious ones — as well as those that lead to airbag deployments.\n\nThis hub compares the Waymo Driver’s Rider-Only (RO) crash rates to human crash benchmarks for surface streets. It leverages [best practices](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2435620) in safety impact analysis and builds upon dozens of Waymo’s [safety publications](../../safety/research), providing an unprecedented level of transparency within the autonomous driving industry. By sharing our data and methodologies, we also invite you to join us as we push for advancements in measuring safety impact.\n\n*The data displayed on this webpage undergoes consistent updates aligned with [NHTSA’s Standing General Order](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting) (SGO) reporting timelines.*\n\n## How the Waymo Driver compares to humans\n\n### Rider-only (RO) miles driven\n\nThrough June 2025, Waymo has driven 96M rider-only miles without a human driver\n\nThe Waymo Driver has tens of millions miles of real-world driving experience.

The *any property damage or injury* comparison had statistically significant decreases in 3 comparisons but also nonsignificant results in 3 other benchmarks. \n\n[Content truncated due to length...]\n\n**Content from https://waymo.com/blog/2024/12/new-swiss-re-study-waymo:**\n[Skip to main content](#main)\n\n[Back](../../../blog)\n\n# New Swiss Re study: Waymo is safer than even the most advanced human-driven vehicles\n\nToday, we’re sharing our [new cutting-edge research](../../../research/do-autonomous-vehicles-outperform-latest-generation-human-driven-vehicles-25-million-miles/) with Swiss Re, one of the world’s leading reinsurers, analyzing liability claims related to collisions from 25.3 million fully autonomous miles driven by Waymo. The study uses auto liability claims aggregate statistics as a proxy for at-fault collisions and expands on our [previous research](../../../blog/2023/09/waymos-autonomous-vehicles-are-significantly-safer-than-human-driven-ones/). It demonstrates that as we've scaled operations across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, the Waymo Driver significantly outperforms both the overall driving population and the latest generation of human-driven vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).\n\nThe study compared Waymo’s liability claims to human driver baselines, which are based on Swiss Re’s data from over 500,000 claims and over 200 billion miles of exposure. It found that the Waymo Driver demonstrated better safety performance when compared to human-driven vehicles, with an 88% reduction in property damage claims and 92% reduction in bodily injury claims. In real numbers, across 25.3 million miles, the Waymo Driver was involved in just nine property damage claims and two bodily injury claims. Both bodily injury claims are still open and described in the paper. For the same distance, human drivers would be expected to have 78 property damage and 26 bodily injury claims.\n\nNotably, the Waymo Driver's safety advantages hold true even when compared to newer vehicles (2018-2021 models) equipped with modern safety technology. This includes advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as automated emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane keeping assistance, and blind spot warning. When compared to this group, the Waymo Driver showed an 86% reduction in property damage claims and 90% reduction in bodily injury claims.\n\nThis analysis complements our [safety impact](../../../safety/impact/) data, which indicates that over 25 million fully autonomous miles, the Waymo Driver had fewer serious collisions than human drivers, independent of who was at fault. This Swiss Re study provides robust evidence that Waymo had no responsibility in the vast majority of the collisions its vehicles were involved in.\n\n“Auto insurance claims data, traditionally used to assess human driver liability and risk, is a powerful tool in evaluating the safety performance of autonomous vehicles,” said Mauricio Peña, Chief Safety Officer at Waymo. “This is a truly groundbreaking study that not only validates the Waymo Driver’s strong safety record, but also provides a scalable framework for ongoing assessment of the impact autonomous vehicles make on road safety.”\n\n\"Our research shows how insurance data can help evaluate autonomous vehicle safety and provide the framework needed to support widespread adoption,” said Ali Shahkarami, Global Head P&C Solutions at Swiss Re. “By analyzing a larger dataset across multiple cities, we deepened our understanding of how this technology performs in real-world conditions. These promising results help underscore the potential of this technology to create a safer future for our roads.\"\n\nThis Swiss Re study provides valuable insights for the broader insurance industry. “It is great to see Waymo placing such an emphasis on the importance of public acceptance of Autonomous Driving System technology, and we agree this can only be achieved through education and the sharing of data,” said Chris Moore, President of Apollo ibott, a Lloyd’s of London Syndicate. “This particular report provided a staggering benchmark in a 90% lower claims frequency compared to human driving of newer vehicles with the most advanced driving assistance technology. We highly commend Waymo for this work and look forward to future study releases as we continue to move to an autonomous future of transportation.”\n\nWe're proud to share these results as part of our ongoing commitment to transparency and rigorous evaluation. As we continue to expand operations and bring the benefits of autonomous driving to more communities, we remain focused on our mission of improving transportation safety and mobility for everyone.\n\nThe paper has been submitted to a scientific journal, and the pre-print is available [here](../../../research/do-autonomous-vehicles-outperform-latest-generation-human-driven-vehicles-25-million-miles/).\n",

We investigated the difference in accident occurrence between Autonomous Vehicles’ levels and Human-Driven Vehicles by utilizing 2100 Advanced Driving Systems and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and 35,113 Human-Driven Vehicles accident data. A matched case-control design was conducted to investigate the differential characteristics involving Autonomous’ versus Human-Driven Vehicles’ accidents. The analysis suggests that accidents of vehicles equipped with Advanced Driving Systems generally have a lower chance of occurring than Human-Driven Vehicles in most of the similar accident scenarios. However, accidents involving Advanced Driving Systems occur more frequently than Human-Driven Vehicle accidents under dawn/dusk or turning conditions, which is 5.25 and 1.98 times higher, respectively. Our research reveals the accident risk disparities between Autonomous Vehicles and Human-Driven Vehicles, informing future development in Autonomous technology and safety enhancements.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDrivers of partially automated vehicles are blamed for crashes that they cannot reasonably avoid\nArticle Open access 28 September 2022\n\nHaptics based multi-level collaborative steering control for automated driving\nArticle Open access 23 January 2023\n\nGeneralization of cut-in pre-crash scenarios for autonomous vehicles based on accident data\nArticle Open access 26 July 2024\nIntroduction\nAutomation of systems has been experiencing rapid development and has brought about a revolution in the transportation industry. The introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) technology has made the vision of a safe transportation system with effortless driving seem attainable. It is anticipated that the automation of systems will significantly reduce the number of accidents, as human errors contribute up to 90% of accidents1. While smart transportation has showcased several benefits, these emerging technologies have also exhibited drawbacks, particularly regarding safety risks.

A criminal information filed today charges Cruise with the offense, which Cruise has agreed to resolve through a deferred prosecution agreement and payment of a $500,000 criminal fine.\n“Federal laws and regulations are in place to protect public safety on our roads. Companies with self-driving cars that seek to share our roads and crosswalks must be fully truthful in their reports to their regulators,” said Martha Boersch, Chief of the Office of the U.S. Attorney’s Criminal Division.\n“Today’s deferred prosecution agreement holds Cruise, LLC and its employees accountable for their lack of candor in a federal regulatory compliance action,” said Cory LeGars, Special Agent-in-Charge, U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General (DOT-OIG), Western Region. “Together with our law enforcement and prosecutorial partners, we will engage our collective resources to pursue companies and individuals who intentionally circumvent administration of federal regulations.”\nThe criminal information alleges that Cruise falsified records in a federal investigation under the jurisdiction of NHTSA within the U.S. Department of Transportation. The criminal investigation and prosecution against Cruise is being resolved with a deferred prosecution agreement in which Cruise admits and accepts responsibility for the charge in the information.\nAccording to the agreement, the crash occurred in San Francisco on Oct. 2, 2023, when a Cruise vehicle operating without a driver ran over a pedestrian who had been thrown into the autonomous vehicle’s path by a human-driven vehicle. The Cruise vehicle stopped after runn\n\n[Content truncated due to length...]\n",

These collision reports are heterogeneous containing a variety of accident factors. Method: To describe the accident more elaborately, we add three new category variables: ‘traffic control and status,’ ‘speed/speed change,’ and ‘type of accident location,’ extracted from crash narratives. Combining with the existing variables as model inputs, we use Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to investigate the mixture types of traffic accidents. After using ‘Mplus’ (LCA tool), the data set with 308 cases has been segmented into three clusters, including ‘rear-end collisions after the speed change of AV,’ ‘sideswipe collisions at parking places,’ and ‘hit-object collisions in normal traffic road.’ Results: These three clusters are not highlighted in previous literature and Cluster 1 shows AV should not be designed too ethically. To follow the driving habits of traditional drivers, AVs should accelerate vehicles quickly when they start to move and delay stopping in front of stop lines, traffic lights, and yielding. The cluster-based analyses show that applying LCA as a preliminary analysis can reveal the interesting hierarchical patterns hidden in the dataset and help traffic safety researchers improve AV safety performances.\n\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\n\nKeywords\nLatent Class Model\nAutomatic Vehicle\nSelf-Driving\nCollision Report\nTraffic Safety\n\nIntroduction\n\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs) represent an emerging technology exploring potential benefits to the transportation industry, including executing driving tasks, improving traffic efficiency, and achieving accident-free travel (Perumal et al., 2021). Many AVs will appear on roads in the next decade with the maturity of self-driving technology. The study predicts AVs will generate $7 trillion of economic value in 2055 (Ryerson et al., 2018). According to a 2015 study by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA, 2015), AV solutions are expected to reduce the number of traffic accidents by eliminating human errors, which result in 93% of roadway crashes. In 2013, NHTSA announced a new policy on vehicle automation, permitting the field testing of emerging vehicle technologies on the real road. Since then, AVs have been continuously validated on public roads in the United States (Beiker, 2014). According to the current AV crash reports, the crash rate of AVs is lower than that of conventional vehicles (CVs) regarding the type of high crash severity. However, some studies show that AVs have a higher rate of accidents than CVs. On average, there are 9.1 AV-involved accidents per million miles, in contrast to 4.1 CV-involved crashes per million miles (Schoettle & Sivak, 2015). AVs in urban may affect up to 17.4% of injury crashes, 26.8% of serious injuries, and 17.1% of fatalities (Malin et al., 2022). These studies show that traffic safety is one of the key challenges for AV commercialization. So far, AVs have not shown significant advantages in reducing road traffic injuries (Ye et al., 2019).\nThe traffic accident data are heterogeneous, including a variety of accident factors, such as drivers’ behaviors, vehicles’ performances, roadway features, and environmental conditions. There are almost 29 variables describing accidents (Depaire et al., 2008). Some of these variables are selected to describe the traffic accident severity such as injury and no injury (Lee et al., 2023), while others are concerned about road users, such as vulnerable roadway users (VRUs) (Kutela et al., 2021). The heterogeneity of incident data creates difficulties in identifying major causes that contribute to the crashes as w\n\n[Content truncated due to length...]\n",

I validated the taxonomy against cluster analyses and case studies in the literature and against SGO/OL‑316 narratives [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\\n\\nFindings — Top incident categories (ranked qualitatively by prevalence in the sources above and with example references)\\nNote: available public datasets are heterogenous and partially redacted; exact national counts by category require full structured parsing of NHTSA/DMV CSVs/PDFs. Below I report conservative, source‑anchored summaries and selected examples.\\n\\n1) Rear‑ended while stopped (AV stationary, hit by another road user)\\n- Evidence & prevalence: Frequent in CA DMV narratives and appears repeatedly in SGO ADS CSV 'Narrative' examples (multiple monthly entries describing AV stopped and struck from behind) [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].\\n- Example: Waymo report (Aug 2025) describes an AV stopped in a right‑turn lane that was struck in the rear by an SUV while Waymo ADS was engaged [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\\n\\n2) AV rear‑ending another vehicle (AV contact while proceeding/starting from stopped)\\n- Evidence & prevalence: Identified as a common cluster in CA report analyses (cluster labelled ‘rear‑end collisions after the speed change of AV’ in latent‑class analysis) and present in SGO narratives [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\\n- Mechanisms: Often associated with AV speed control (initial acceleration/slow follow), sensor/perception ambiguities in dense stop‑and‑go traffic, or conservative gap acceptance leading to late acceleration responses [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634].\\n\\n3) Intersection / turning conflicts (including cut‑ins, failed yields and turn‑related collisions)\\n- Evidence & prevalence: Nature Communications matched‑case study and other papers identify turns and intersection maneuvers as a relatively higher‑risk context for ADS vs human drivers; the Nature study reports AV accidents were more likely under turning conditions (odds ratio ≈ 1.98) and at dawn/dusk (odds ratio ≈ 5.25) relative to matched human‑driver cases [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4].

Key source URLs used: NHTSA ADS CSV (https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv) [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv]; CA DMV collision reports index (https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/) [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/]; Waymo safety hub (https://waymo.com/safety/impact/) [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/]; Kusano et al., Traffic Injury Prevention (2024) (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2380786) [Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2380786]; Nature Communications matched case-control (2024) (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4) [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4]; Latent class analysis (Journal of Safety Research, 2025) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634) [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634]; Cruise consent order (NHTSA PDF) (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf) [Source: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf]; DOJ press release re: Cruise DPA (https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/cruise-admits-submitting-false-report-influence-federal-investigation-and-agrees-pay) [Source: https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/cruise-admits-submitting-false-report-influence-federal-investigation-and-agrees-pay].\n\nDecisions\n- Research subagent - 2025-11-10T04:32:00Z: Taxonomy & framing — I mapped reported events into a pragmatic incident taxonomy used in the literature and regulatory narratives for urban ADS operations: (A) being rear‑ended while stopped or slowing (AV as stationary victim), (B) AV rear‑ending or striking another vehicle while moving (AV-initiated contact), (C) intersection/turning conflicts (including cutting/turning and red‑light/stop sign interactions), (D) vulnerable road user (VRU) incidents — pedestrian/cyclist strikes or detection failures and near‑misses, (E) sideswipe/merging/ lane‑change conflicts, (F) fixed/object strikes or roadway boundary contacts, and (G) disengagement or operator‑control transitions that precede collisions. I validated the taxonomy against cluster analyses and case studies in the literature and against SGO/OL‑316 narratives [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\n\nFindings — Top incident categories (ranked qualitatively by prevalence in the sources above and with example references)\nNote: available public datasets are heterogenous and partially redacted; exact national counts by category require full structured parsing of NHTSA/DMV CSVs/PDFs. Below I report conservative, source‑anchored summaries and selected examples.\n\n1) Rear‑ended while stopped (AV stationary, hit by another road user)\n- Evidence & prevalence: Frequent in CA DMV narratives and appears repeatedly in SGO ADS CSV 'Narrative' examples (multiple monthly entries describing AV stopped and struck from behind) [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].\n- Example: Waymo report (Aug 2025) describes an AV stopped in a right‑turn lane that was struck in the rear by an SUV while Waymo ADS was engaged [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\n\n2) AV rear‑ending another vehicle (AV contact while proceeding/starting from stopped)\n- Evidence & prevalence: Identified as a common cluster in CA report analyses (cluster labelled ‘rear‑end collisions after the speed change of AV’ in latent‑class analysis) and present in SGO narratives [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\n- Mechanisms: Often associated with AV speed control (initial acceleration/slow follow), sensor/perception ambiguities in dense stop‑and‑go traffic, or conservative gap acceptance leading to late acceleration responses [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634].\n\n3) Intersection / turning conflicts (including cut‑ins, failed yields and turn‑related collisions)\n- Evidence & prevalence: Nature Communications matched‑case study and other papers identify turns and intersection maneuvers as a relatively higher‑risk context for ADS vs human drivers; the Nature study reports AV accidents were more likely under turning conditions (odds ratio ≈ 1.98) and at dawn/dusk (odds ratio ≈ 5.25) relative to matched human‑driver cases [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4]. CA DMV narratives also frequently record collisions during turning or at intersections [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].\n\n4) Vulnerable road user (VRU) incidents — pedestrian/cyclist detection failures, run‑overs, dragging events, and near‑misses\n- Evidence & prevalence: High regulatory and investigative attention — Cruise’s Oct 2023 pedestrian run‑over and dragging incident (subject of NHTSA inquiry, consent order, and DOJ deferred‑prosecution action) is a high‑profile example of detection/response failure and reporting problems [Source: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf] [Source: https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/cruise-admits-submitting-false-report-influence-federal-investigation-and-agrees-pay]. CA DMV reports and SGO CSV entries include pedestrian/cyclist‑involved incidents and near‑miss narratives [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\n- Example quantification (company/claims level): Waymo + Swiss Re analysis across 25.3M autonomous miles found very low counts of liability claims (9 property‑damage claims, 2 bodily‑injury claims) and large reductions vs human baselines — used as a company‑level safety benchmark but not a taxonomy of crash types [Source: https://waymo.com/blog/2024/12/new-swiss-re-study-waymo] [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/].\n\n5) Sideswipe / merging / lane‑change conflicts\n- Evidence & prevalence: Appears in CA DMV clusters and SGO narratives (including parking/low‑speed sideswipe clusters in LCA) [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\n\n6) Fixed‑object / curb / boundary contacts\n- Evidence: Reported repeatedly in CA narratives and SGO CSV (AV contacting poles/curbs/guardrails or road furniture in urban environments) — often lower severity but indicative of localization/path‑planning edge cases [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].\n\n7) Disengagement / operator transition preceded collisions\n- Evidence: Several SGO/OL‑316 narratives describe operator intervention, braking or steering by a human during or immediately after the event; regulatory documents emphasize that some collisions occur during or immediately after an operator takes control or when the ADS was transitioning [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].\n\nContributing factors — breakdown with quantification where available\n- Lighting/time-of-day (dawn/dusk): Nature Communications found a marked increase in AV accident likelihood at dawn/dusk (≈5.25× higher odds compared to matched human cases) [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4].\n- Turning maneuvers: Nature reported turning conditions had ≈1.98× higher odds for AV accidents than human drivers in matched comparisons [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4].\n- Speed change / stop‑and‑go acceleration profiles: The latent‑class analysis of CA DMV crash narratives identified a dominant cluster characterized as ‘rear‑end after AV speed change,’ linking AV speed-control behavior to a substantial share of collisions in that sample (clustering over a 308‑case CA dataset) [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634].\n- External actors’ failure to yield / human driver fault (AV as victim): CA DMV and SGO narratives repeatedly show other drivers failing to yield or driving into the AV’s path — a commonly reported causal text string in narratives [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\n- Perception/detection limits for VRUs: High‑profile Cruise case and other narratives point to sensor/perception misses or classification failures as critical factors in VRU incidents; regulatory documents and the DOJ press release detail concrete failures to detect and to report accurately [Source: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf] [Source: https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/cruise-admits-submitting-false-report-influence-federal-investigation-and-agrees-pay].\n- Reporting quality, redactions, & data heterogeneity: CA DMV reports are often redacted for PII; SGO reports are voluntary in structure (narratives vary) and NHTSA has noted caveats in available SGO reporting (unverified initial reports, redactions) — these limit precise national quantification without programmatic parsing and harmonization [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\n\nComparison to human drivers (where available)\n- Aggregated safety impact (miles‑normalized): Waymo’s peer‑reviewed RO analysis (Kusano et al.) and the Waymo safety hub show ADS (Waymo Driver) crash rates per million miles substantially lower than human benchmarks for serious injuries, airbag deployments, and any‑injury crashes (e.g., Waymo RO any‑injury IPMM 0.80 vs human benchmark 3.96 in combined locations reported on Waymo hub; Kusano et al. report ~0.6 IPMM ADS any‑injury vs 2.80 IPMM human benchmark for their 7.14M‑mile sample) — these comparisons are mile‑normalized and not a direct decomposition by crash category, but they provide evidence that ADS operations to date have lower per‑mile injury crash rates in Waymo’s operating cities [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/] [Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2380786].\n- Case‑matched differences by scenario: Nature Communications matched case‑control shows that, overall, ADS‑equipped vehicles have lower accident odds in many scenarios but higher odds in specific contexts (dawn/dusk and turning) — indicating scenario‑dependent relative risk vs human drivers [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4].\n- Company‑level claims analysis (insurance proxy): Waymo + Swiss Re analysis over 25.3M miles reported large reductions in property‑damage and bodily‑injury claim frequencies vs human baselines (88% PD reduction; 92% BI reduction), but this is an insurance‑claims proxy and does not specify a breakdown by crash type [Source: https://waymo.com/blog/2024/12/new-swiss-re-study-waymo] [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/].\n\nData gaps, limitations, and quantification caveats\n- Heterogeneous reporting and redactions: CA DMV PDFs are often redacted; SGO CSV narratives are variable and may contain PII redactions and “unknown” flags — both limit automated classification without careful preprocessing [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\n- Company sample bias: Waymo analyses reflect their operating cities and fleet ODDs and should not be generalized nationwide without adjustment; similarly, Cruise regulatory materials highlight under‑reporting and reporting‑quality problems that reduce confidence in aggregated counts absent independent verification [Source: https://waymo.com/safety/impact/] [Source: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-09/cruise-consent-order-2024-web.pdf].\n- Lack of harmonized, category‑level national counts: Peer‑reviewed analyses use compiled datasets (e.g., Nature used 2,100 AV records) and local DMV files; however, there is not yet a single authoritative, fully harmonized national AV crash ontology covering 2018–2025Q3 that reports category percentages — producing exact percentage splits requires programmatic parsing of SGO CSV and CA OL‑316 PDFs and mapping of narrative text to a standard taxonomy (this parsing remains to be completed) [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4] [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv].\n\nConclusions (condensed)\n- The dominant incident types in urban ADS operations 2018–2025Q3 (by frequency in public narratives and cluster analyses) are: (1) being rear‑ended while stopped, (2) AV‑rear‑end collisions associated with AV speed changes, (3) intersection/turn‑related conflicts, (4) VRU‑related incidents (pedestrians/cyclists — including high‑profile detection failures), (5) sideswipe/merging conflicts, (6) fixed‑object/curb strikes, and (7) collisions occurring during or immediately after human disengagement/transition. Each category is supported by at least two source types in the public record (SGO CSV entries and CA DMV PDFs plus peer‑reviewed cluster/matched‑case analyses and company/regulatory disclosures) [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/] [Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437524001634] [Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48526-4].\n\nFollow‑ups (for the lead researcher — I executed data collection and this is the sub‑report to integrate)\n- Research subagent - 2025-11-10T04:32:00Z: Deliverable status — Subtask complete: I assembled taxonomy, sourced supporting evidence, and quantified scenario‑level risk where peer‑reviewed studies provided numbers (dawn/dusk odds, turning odds, miles‑normalized IPMM benchmarks). Key remaining technical task for final lead analysis: programmatic parsing & classification of the full SGO ADS CSV plus batch extraction of CA DMV OL‑316 PDF narratives to produce precise frequency counts and percentage breakdowns for 2018–2025Q3 (this requires OCR/PII‑aware parsing and mapping to the taxonomy). Primary data files to parse: SGO ADS CSV (https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv) and CA DMV OL‑316 PDF set (index at https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/) [Source: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADS.csv] [Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/].\n\nEnd of sub‑report.",
